# Health Points & Death’s Door

## Health Points

Health Points (HP) are a game statistic representing a
creature’s ability to sustain damage. The stronger the
creature the more HP it generally has, signifying the greater
difficulty in defeating it.

> **Example:** A Commoner has 4 HP, a Mastiff has 3 HP, a Cat has 2 HP and a Rat has 1 HP.

> **DC Tip:** Most damage a creature takes is nonlethal and just “wears them down” until they get closer and closer to Death’s Door. Lighter hits might graze you, while bigger hits knock you off your feet. The description and roleplay of how damage is taken can change depending on its source and the situation, but Health Points represent how much of a beating you can take before you die.

### Health Points at 1st Level

A PC has a number of Health Points equal to Class HP
+ Might. A PC might also gain additional HP from its
Ancestry, such the Dwarf Trait Tough (+1 HP) or the Elf
Trait Frail (-2 HP).

**Health Point Formula:**

```
Class HP + Might + Ancestry HP (if any)
```

> **Example:** A PC picks the Champion Class at Level 1 and
starts with a Might of 3 (the highest possible at Level 1). The
Champion Class grants a base of 9 HP. The PC then adds +3
HP from their Might to get a total of 12 HP (9 + 3). If any of
their Ancestry Traits increase or decrease their HP, they would
add those to the total to determine their starting HP.

### Temporary Health Points

Temporary Health Points (Temp HP) are additional Health Points that persist for a limited duration. When you take damage, your Temp HP is reduced first, and then any remaining damage carries over to reduce your HP.

*   **Stacking:** Temp HP doesn’t stack. If you gain Temp HP from different effects, you choose which effect to gain Temp HP from, and ignore the Temp HP granted by the other effects.
*   **Duration:** Temp HP lasts until you complete a Long Rest, or its reduced to 0 by taking damage. An effect that grants Temp HP may state a shorter duration, such as 1 minute, until you complete a Quick Rest, or a Short Rest. When the duration expires, all Temp HP gained immediately vanish. 

### Health Thresholds

Certain game mechanics affect creatures while their current
HP is within certain thresholds. These HP thresholds
are determined before any temporary changes to your
HP maximum, such as from the Doomed Condition or
the Aid Spell.

* **Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/2 its maximum
HP.
* **Well-Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/4 its
maximum HP.
* **Death’s Door:** HP is equal to or lower than 0 HP, to a
minimum of its Death Threshold.

A creature’s Death Threshold is equal to 0 HP minus its
Prime Modifier and its Combat Mastery.

> **DC Tip:** If a creature is on Death’s Door, they are still
considered to be Bloodied and Well-Bloodied, because their
HP is still below 1/2 their maximum (Bloodied) and 1/4 their
maximum (Well-Bloodied).

> **Example:** A creature with a maximum HP of 8 is considered
Bloodied when its HP is 4 or lower, Well-Bloodied when its
HP is 2 or lower, and on Death’s Door when its HP is 0 or
lower. If its Prime Modifier is 3 and its Combat Mastery is 1,
the creature’s Death Threshold is -4 HP. That creature dies if
its HP is ever reduced to -4 HP or lower.

## Death’s Door

When a PC is reduced to 0 HP they’re on “Death’s Door”
and fighting for their life. This is represented in whatever
way the player wants to describe this state looks like for
their character. They are NOT unconscious, they are in
a heavily weakened state about to die if something is not
done SOON! They could be prone crawling on the ground,
holding themselves up with their sword, or spitting out
blood as they hold on for dear life.

### Entering Death’s Door

When you’re reduced to 0 HP or lower, you gain
Exhaustion 1. Until you are restored to 1 HP or higher,
you suffer the following effects:

* **Action Point Limit:** Your current and maximum AP are
reduced by 3.
* **Death Save:** You must make a DC 10 Death Save at the
start of each of your turns (see Death Saves for more
information).

> **DC Tip:** You basically can only spend 1 AP per round of
Combat, either on your turn or as a Reaction. This usually
happens while on Death’s Door.

### Death Saves

When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20 to
determine if it Succeeds or Fails the Save.

**Success**
* **Success:** No change.
* **Success (5):** You regain 1 HP.
* **Critical Success:** You are restored to 1 HP.

**Failure**
* **Failure:** You gain Bleeding 1.
* **Failure (5):** You gain Bleeding 2 instead.
* **Critical Failure:** You also fall Unconscious until you’re
restored to 1 HP or higher.

> **DC Tip:** If you are on Death’s Door outside of Combat, you
repeat the Death Save every 12 seconds instead (5 times
per minute).

### NPC’s on Death’s Door

Monsters and NPCs normally die when they’re reduced to
0 HP, however the Game Master can choose to implement
Death’s Door on special enemies. They would drop down
to 1 AP and be on Death’s Door in that same weakened
state, leaving a window for them to still talk to the party
and get out any last words before someone puts them out
of their misery.

    *Bleeding X (Condition)*

    You take X True damage at the start of each
    of your turns.

    **Ending Bleeding:** All stacks of the Condition
    end when you’re subjected to an effect that
    restores your HP. Alternatively, a creature
    can attempt to remove 1 or more stacks of
    the Condition by taking the Medicine Action.

    *Medicine (Action)*

    You can spend 1 AP to touch a creature and
    tend to its wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine
    Check. Success: You end 1 stack of Bleeding
    on the target. Success (each 5): You end an
    additional stack of Bleeding.

    *First Aid Kit (Equipment)*

    You can spend 1 Charge and take the Object
    Action to treat a Bloodied creature’s wounds
    (see First Aid Kit for more information). Make
    a DC 10 Medicine Check. Success: Target
    creature regains 1 HP. Success (each 5): The
    creature regains +1 HP.
