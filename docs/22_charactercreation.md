# 10 Step Character Creation Outline

During Player Character (PC) Creation, you will get to customize your PC in the following ways at Level 1:

* Choose Starting Attributes
* Choose Save Masteries
* Choose Background (Skills, Trades, and Languages)
* Choose an Ancestry, and Class

## Player Character Creation

### Step 1: Attributes & Prime Modifier

You get your PC Attributes from one of the following methods and then assign the values to each of the 4 Attributes.

**Standard Array**

You start with an array of 3, 1, 0, -2 and assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain 2 additional Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**Point Buy**

You start with a -2 in all of your Attributes. You then gain 12 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

> DC Tip: Your Prime Modifier (see later in this chapter) comes from your highest Attribute, so it’s a good idea to make sure that you get a 3 in at least one of your Attributes. 

**Roll Method**

You determine your starting values by rolling 1d6-3 four times, and then assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain +2 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

Prime Modifier Insurance: If the value of your highest Attribute is less than 3 (even after adding the +2 Attribute Points), you can reduce a different Attribute value by 1 or more to increase your highest Attribute by the same amount. You can’t reduce an Attribute value below -2 or increase an Attribute above your Attribute Limit (3).

> DC Tip: This method of determining your starting Attributes is the most risky. It offers the potential for the highest starting Attributes, but also the lowest. If you add all your Attributes together, their sum should be 2 (on average). If you get less than this, talk to your GM about potentially rerolling your Attributes (or using a different method).

**Prime Modifier**

Your Prime Modifier is equal to your PC’s highest Attribute.

> DC Tip: You really want your PC to have a 3 in one of their Attributes so they can have a 3 for their Prime Modifier at level 1. This is going to add to a lot of the things you do in Combat and is very important. 

### Step 2: Save Masteries

You get to choose 2 Attributes to gain Save Mastery in at Level 1. Choose 2 of the 4 Attributes, and you’re now able to add your Combat Mastery to those Saves. There’s a “Saves” section on your Character Sheet next to each Attribute. Bubble in the circle for those you have Save Mastery in and write in your totals for each.

> DC Tip: If you don’t have Mastery in the Save, then the value you write down will be equal to your Attribute. BUT in the 2 Saves that you chose to gain Mastery in, you add +1 to the Attribute, and that’s what you write down for the Save. 

### Step 3: Background (Skills, Trades, & Languages)

This represents how your were raised, what type of culture you were around, and what you have done since birth. You gain “Traits” from your Background at 1st level that grant you some flavorful or mechanical benefits.

Each Background gives 5 Skill Points, 3 Trade Points, and 2 Language Points. You can’t go over the Mastery Limit of Novice unless you have a Feature that allows you to do so.

> Beta Note: The only piece “missing” from Background is a “Background Trait”. This will be something 100% FLAVOR based and only enhance Roleplay. 

**Skills**

Your Background gives you 5 Skill Points, but you also increase or decrease your Skill Points based on your Intelligence Attribute.

Knowledge Skills: Remember, if you put 1 Skill Point into a Knowledge Skill, you get a free “bonus point” to put into any other Knowledge Skill. You still have to follow the Mastery Cap of Novice though.

> DC Tip: Bards get 2 more Skill Points at level 1 in their Class Table. 

**Starting Skill Points formula:**
```
Starting Skill Points = 5 + Intelligence (yes, you do subtract if your Intelligence is negative).
```

**Trades**

Your Background gives you 3 Trade Points. You can convert 1 Skill Point into 1 Trade point, but not the other way around.

**Languages**

Your Background gives you Fluency in the Common Language and 2 Language Points that you can spend on Mortal or Exotic Languages of your choice. Additionally, you can convert 1 Trade Point into 2 Language Points.

**Background Starting Equipment**

Coming Soon. You get a list of starting equipment based on your Background. You could instead choose to receive a flat amount of gold or even roll for your gold

### Step 4: Health Points

Fill in your character’s HP. You may potentially add more if you choose an Ancestry or Class that grants bonus HP at Level 1.

**Starting HP Formula:**
```
6 + Character Level + Might
```

> DC Tip: To simplify this I always tell players that their starting HP is 7 + Might, and that, yes, you do subtract if Might is negative. Also, how Class Bonus HP works is that all Martials (and Warlocks) get +1 HP and all Spellcasters get +0 HP (this makes it very easy to remember). Then we add in extra HP from Ancestry once they choose it later. 


### Step 5: Stamina & Mana Points

Fill in your Characters SP and MP. Martial Characters have 1 Stamina Points (SP), Spellcasters have 6 Mana Points (MP), and Hybrid Characters (such as a Spellblade) have 3 Mana Points (MP).

### Step 6: Defense

Fill in your character's Physical and Mystical Defense.

**Physical Defense**

Unarmored, Light Armor, and Heavy Armor all use the following Formula:

> DC Tip: Armor Bonus for both Light Armor and Heavy Armor is +1.

```
Physical Defense = 8 + CM + Agility + Armor Bonus
```

Barbarians and Monks have unique Formulas for their PD if they choose not to wear Armor:

```
Barbarians = 8 + CM + (Agility or Might) + 2
Monk = 8 + CM + Agility + 2
```

**Mystical Defense**

Almost all character’s Mystical Defense uses the same Formula:

```
Mystical Defense = 8 + CM + Charisma + Intelligence
```

Monks have a unique Formula for their MD:

```
Monk = 8 + CM + Charisma + Intelligence + 2
```

**Damage Reduction**

Fill in each section’s Damage Reduction.

* Physical Damage Reduction: This only applies if you’re wearing Heavy Armor (or have some other feature that grants PDR).
* Mystical Damage Reduction: This is most likely 0 for everyone (unless you have a feature that grants it).

### Step 7: Combat Modifiers

Fill out the rest of the blanks on your Character Sheet.

* Attack / Spell Check: +4
* Save DC: 14
* Martial Check: Highest between Athletics or Acrobatics
* Death Threshold: -3
* Move Speed: 5
* Jump Distance: Equals your Agility (minimum of 1)
* Rest Points: Might (minimum of 0) + 1
* Grit Points: 2 + Charisma

### Step 8: Ancestry

Choose an Ancestry. This represents your biology and how you have grown and developed since birth. You gain Ancestry Traits from your chosen Ancestry at 1st, 4th, and 7th level.

> **DC Tip:** There are many different ways to create Ancestries (both visually and mechanically). Make sure to collaborate where needed with your GM. 

**Ancestry Traits**

You choose 1 or 2 Ancestries to gain access to. You also get 5 Ancestry points that you can use to spend on Ancestry Traits (see “Ancestry System” on page 97 for more).

> **DC Tip:** Some of these Traits might affect things you’ve already added to your Character Sheet (such as HP, Speed, etc.).

### Step 9: Class

Choose a Class. This represents how well trained you are in martial combat, spellcasting, or both. You gain Class Features at Level 1, 2, 5, and 8.

All Classes get to choose a Subclass at 3rd Level, and gain additional Subclass Features at Level 6 and Level 9. Keep this in mind when creating your character along with their flavor and backstory so that it blends well and “makes sense” when you get to Level 3.

> Example: If you know you’re going to choose “Dragon Bloodline Sorcerer” then you should probably flavor some of your PC’s appearance or how they cast their spells with a draconic theme.

> DC Tip: If you don’t know what you’re going to select yet, that’s fine as well. I just recommend THINKING about it. 

**Class Features**

You gain a number of Class Features at Level 1 based on which Class you chose (see Classes for more)

* Bonus HP: All Classes have a Bonus HP column in their Class Table. Martials get +1 Bonus HP, and all Spellcasters do not get any Bonus HP.
* Cantrips, Spells, Maneuvers Known: Check your Class Table to see if you have any of these to pick.
* Skill Points: If your background already gave you one or more of these Skills, you can replace those Skills from this list with any Skill of your choice.

### Step 10: Weapons & Inventory

Choose what starting equipment you want. You gain some from your Class and the rest from your Background. 

> Beta Note: Currently the only thing this is right now is Weapons and Armor. Starting Equipment will be added in a future update. I personally let my PCs choose from a list of general adventuring supplies and we go from there. 

## Further Player Character Progression

Characters get stronger as they increase in Level. This chart shows what you get at each Level for all Classes.

> DC Tip: This table is a general representation of what the “standard” is for all classes, but make sure to check your Class specifically just in case.

## Leveling Up

When a character levels up, these are the updates you need to make.

**Combat Mastery**

At levels 3, 5, 7, and 9 (all “odd” levels) your Combat Mastery increases by 1. The following things use Combat Mastery and would also increase by 1.

* Physical and Mystical Defense
* Attack and Spell Checks
* Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence Saves (that you have Mastery in)
* Save DC

**Attribute Points**

Check your Player Character Progression Table and see if you gain any Attribute points.

* If you increase an Attribute, then you must also increase each Skill that’s connected to that Attribute by the same amount.
* Possibly increase your Prime Modifier if you just increased your highest Attribute to be higher than it was before.
* Update the Saves of any Attributes you increased. You should also check on the Physical or Mental Saves if those were changed.

**Skill, Trade, & Language Points**

Check your Player Character Progression Table and see if you gain any Skill Points or Trade Points.

* If you do, spend them to increase your Mastery Levels and increase those modifiers. 

> DC Tip: Remember not to exceed the “Mastery Limit” depending on what level you are. Level 5 is Adept, Level 10 is Expert, Level 15 is Master, and Level 20 is Grandmaster. 

**Health**

These are the categories that you could gain HP in:

* Every PC’s Health increases by 1 when they level up.
* Check to see if your Class Table grants any additional “Bonus HP”.
* If you increase your Might Attribute, then you also increase your HP by 1 for each point of Might you gain.
* You may also gain an Ancestry Trait or other Talent that grants bonus HP. 

> DC Tip: Since part of the formula for PC Health includes your level, this means everyone always gains at least 1 HP. 

**Defense**

* Physical Defense: Agility is part of your Defense Formula, so for each +1 to Agility you get, increase your PD by +1.
* Mystical Defense: For each +1 to Charisma and Intelligence you get, increase your MD by 1.

## Additional Options

### Max Level 10 + Prestige Levels

The “max level” for each Class in DC20 RPG is Level 10, but there is a Prestige Path that unlocks at level 11. You can choose the Martial Path, Spellcaster Path, or Hybrid Path. These Prestige Paths grant additional bonuses, points, and Talents and will let you level up to level 20. This can be repeated again if the group wants to continue their story.
