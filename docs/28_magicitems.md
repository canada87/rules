# Magic Item System

## Magic Items

Magic items are enchanted objects imbued with Magical Properties that provide various benefits to their wielder. You can’t use or benefit from a Magic Item unless you’re wielding it (such as a Weapon or Shield) or it’s equipped into one of your Equipment Slots (such as your Head, Body, or Belt).

## Magic Properties

Magic Items possess Magic Properties that grant them unique benefits and abilities. A Magic Item can’t have more than 3 Magic Properties, and it can’t have the same Magic Property more than once. Magic Properties that share the same name, but have the Minor, Moderate, or Major distinctions count as the same Magic Property.

### Stackable Magic Properties

Some Magic Properties can be increased in potency to create a more powerful effect. These Magic Properties have the word Stackable listed in parenthesis next to their Magic Power entry. When you increase the potency of a Magic Property, it counts as having that Property only once.

> **Example:** The Magic Property: Health Increase has a Magic Power of 1 and grants +3 maximum HP. That Magic Property could be increased to a Magic Power of 2 and grant +6 maximum HP instead.

### Unique Magic Properties

Unique Magic Properties grant very distinctive and extraordinary benefits to Magic Items. These special Magic Properties don’t count against the number of Magic Properties a Magic Item can possess, but a Magic Item can’t have more than 1 Unique Property at a time.

## Magic Power

Magic Properties possess Magic Power that serves as a gauge for its strength, effectiveness, and the complexity of its enchantments. The Magic Power of an item is equal to the total Magic Power of all its properties.

*   **Magic Power 0:** A Magic Item can only bear 1 Magic Property at a time with a Magic Power of 0.

## Attunement

Some Magic Items require Attunement for a creature to gain its magical benefits. The process of Attunement forms a magical bond between the creature and the item that persists until the Attunement ends. A creature can spend 1 AP to Attune to a Magic Item it’s holding (that’s not also held by another creature) or to end its Attunement with one.

*   **Contested Attunement:** If you attempt to Attune to a Magic Item that’s already Attuned to another creature, you must make a Contested Flat Charisma Check against the other creature. **Success:** You Attune to the Magic Item and the Attunement with the other creature immediately ends. **Failure:** The Attunement fails, and you’re unable to try again until 1 hour has passed.
*   **Attunement Limit:** You can Attune to a maximum number of Magic Items equal to your Prime Modifier. If you Attune to another Magic Item while you’re already at your Attunement Limit, your Attunement to one existing Magic Item of your choice immediately ends.

## Magic Item Charges

Some Magic Items have a limited number of uses that are measured in Charges. Each time you use the item, a certain number of Charges are spent as indicated by its description. The spent Charges automatically replenish after the creature completes a Long Rest, provided they possess the item for the entire duration of the Rest.

## Using a Magic Item

Activating an item or using one of its Charges requires taking the Object Action, unless otherwise stated in its description. You can’t use an item unless you’re wielding it or it’s equipped into one of your Equipment Slots.

### Equipment Slots Sidebar

Items can be worn in Equipment Slots that collectively cover your entire body. Each Equipment Slot can only have 1 item equipped at a time. It takes 1 AP to equip or unequip an item in an Equipment Slot, except the Body Slot which takes 1 minute.

*   **Head:** Items worn on the head, such as glasses, goggles, a hat, a hood, a crown, or a helmet.
*   **Neck:** Items worn around the neck, such as a necklace, amulet, or choker.
*   **Mantle:** Items worn on the shoulders, such as a cloak, cape, shawl, scarf, backpack, or pauldrons.
*   **Body:** Armor or Vestments worn on the torso and legs, such as a shirt and trousers, vest and shorts, tunic and leggings, or a cuirass and greaves.
*   **Belt:** Items worn around the waist, such as a belt, sash, or waistband.
*   **Boots:** Items worn on the feet, such as boots, sandals, or sabatons.
*   **Hands:** Items worn on the hands, such as gloves, bracers, hand wraps, or gauntlets.
*   **Ring (Left):** A ring worn on the left hand.
*   **Ring (Right):** A ring worn on the right hand.

> **DC Tip:** A creature can’t benefit from more than 1 Magic Ring per Hand because the magic from multiple Magic Rings in close proximity conflict with each other making them unreliable or unstable.
