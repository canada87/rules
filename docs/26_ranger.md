## Ranger

Rangers are expert hunters, master survivalists, and natural explorers. They mark their targets to better track and kill them with their use of terrain, traps, and weapons.

**Source of Power:** Rangers use their experience and knowledge of the dangers of nature and the creatures that live within it. They can adapt to all sorts of environments and use what they learn to their advantage.

You have developed a trove of knowledge hunting creatures which you’ve recorded in your Bestiary. Your Bestiary can take the form of a book or a memory vault within your mind. You have ADV on Checks made to learn or recall information about any creature recorded in your Bestiary.

* **Starting Entries:** Choose a Creature Type: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, or Undead. Your Bestiary includes pre-recorded notes about various creatures of the chosen type.

**Hunter’s Strike:** You can spend 1 SP as part of a Weapon Attack to add 1 of the effects listed below. You can only use 1 of these effects per Attack Check. If an effect forces the target to make a Save, it does so against your Save DC.
