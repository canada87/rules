# Resting

This happens during Exploration but are specific moments when PCs stop to rest and recover their resources, spend Rest Points, and perform specific Rest Actions. This could be 10 minutes, 1 hour, or 8 hours depending on the type of Rest being taken. These moments can have some Roleplay and descriptions of what happens, but they’re primarily mechanical in nature.

## Rest Terms

* **Rest Points:** You have a number of Rest Points equal to your Might (minimum of 0) + your Character Level.
* **No Activity:** Sleeping, meditating, or contemplating while idle.
* **Light Activity:** Non-strenuous activity that requires little effort, such as talking, reading, eating, bandaging wounds, light foraging, and standing watch.
* **Strenuous Activity:** Any activity that requires physical exertion, such as traveling, hunting, exercising, training, or casting spells.
* **Dangerous Activity:** Any activity that causes extreme injury or stress, such as engaging in combat with a hostile creature.

## Types of Rest

### Quick Rest

A period of No Activity or Light Activity and is at least 10 minutes long. You can only gain the benefits of 2 Quick Rests per 24 hour period.

**Quick Rest Benefits:** You can spend 1 or more Rest Points, up to your maximum, at the end of a Quick Rest. When you do, you regain 2 HP per Rest Point spent.

### Short Rest

A period of No Activity or Light Activity and is at least 1 hour long. You can only gain the benefits of 2 Short Rests per 24 hour period.

**Short Rest Benefits:** At any point during a Short Rest, you can spend Rest Points to regain HP following the same rules as a Quick Rest. Some Features regain expended uses when you complete a Short Rest (as listed in the Feature’s description).

### Long Rest

A period of 4 hours of Light Activity and 4 hours of No Activity, taken in either order, for a total of 8 hours of resting. If one of the 4 hour periods is interrupted by any amount of Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity you must begin that 4 hour period again. You can only gain the benefits of 1 Long Rest per 24 hour period.

**Long Rest Benefits**

* **At any point during a Long Rest**, you can spend Rest Points to regain HP following the same rules as a Quick Rest.
* **Half Long Rest:** At the end of the first 4 hour period of the rest, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest and regain all spent Rest Points.

    > **DC Tip:** Make sure to spend any unused Rest Points at the beginning of a Long Rest, since you regain all spent Rest Points after the first 4 hours of a Long Rest.

* **Complete Long Rest:** At the end of the second 4 hour period of the rest, you gain the full benefits of completing the Long Rest. Some Features regain expended uses when you complete a Long Rest (as listed in the Feature’s description), such as regaining all spent MP. 

    > **DC Tip:** You might just want to take a Half Long Rest (4 hour rest) if you only need to regain HP.

**Doomed**

When you complete a Long Rest, you lose all stacks of the Doomed Condition.

**Exhaustion**

For each 4 hour period doing No Activity, you decrease your Exhaustion by 1. If you spend both 4 hour periods doing Light Activity, you must make a DC 10 Might Save. 
* **Failure:** You gain Exhaustion 1 and the DC of this Save increases by 5 until you complete a Full Rest.

### Full Rest

A 24 hour or longer period (determined by the GM) that is spent in an area of safety, such as a town, where you can eat well, rest, and recover. If the Full Rest is interrupted by any amount of Dangerous Activity you must begin it again.

**Full Rest Benefits:** At the end of a Full Rest, you gain the benefits of a Long Rest and lose all levels of Exhaustion. Your GM can determine if the Full Rest also grants additional benefits by choosing from the list below (or by making up something that makes more sense in the given situation):

* Gain Temp HP equal to your Prime Modifier, your level, or twice your level.
* Gain ADV on a type of Check, Save or both for a given period of time (1 day, 1 week, etc.).
