## Fighter

Fighters are weapon and armor specialists that push themselves to the limit in combat. They’re able to master a wide variety of weapon types and learn their enemies as they fight them.

**Source of Power:** Fighters train intensely to master all types of weapons and armor. They could be outfitted in heavy armor and a shield, swing a greatsword with ease, or become a highly trained archer.

### Fighter Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Fighter Stamina
You regain 1 SP when you perform 1 or more Maneuvers as part of an Action, provided you don’t spend SP as part of that Action.

> **Example:** If you spend 1 AP to make a Martial Attack and then spend 3 AP to perform 3 Maneuvers on the Attack, you would only regain 1 SP. 

##### Technique Master
You learn 1 Technique of your choice. Once per Combat, when you perform a Technique you can reduce its SP cost by 1.

##### Adaptive Arsenal
You are highly trained with all forms of combat weaponry and gain the following benefits:

* **Quick Swap:** In Combat at the start of each of your turns, you can freely swap any Weapon you are currently wielding in each hand for any other Weapon.
* **Fighting Styles:** You can benefit from one of the following Fighting Styles below, determined by the Weapon(s) you're currently wielding.
    * **Dueling:** *Requires: 1-Handed Melee Weapon + Free Hand.* When a Melee Attack Misses you, you gain ADV on the next Attack you make with the Weapon against the Attacker before the end of your next turn.

          > **DC Tip:** While Dueling you can wield a mundane item in your off hand, such as a torch.
  
    * **Great Weapon:** *Requires: 2-Handed Melee Weapon.* Once per turn, when you Hit a target with the Weapon, you gain ADV on the next Attack you make with the Weapon against the same target before the end of your next turn.
    * **Marksman:** *Requires: Ranged Weapon.* Once per turn, when you Miss a target with the Weapon, you gain ADV on the next Attack you make with the Weapon against the same target before the end of your next turn.
    * **Shielded:** *Requires: Shield.* Once per turn, when an Attack Hits you, the next Attack made against you before the start of your next turn has DisADV.
    * **Two Weapon:** *Requires: Dual Wielding Melee Weapons.* Once per turn, when you Hit a target with one Weapon, you gain ADV on the next Attack you make with the other Weapon against a different target before the end of your next turn.

##### Know Your Enemy (Flavor Feature)
You can spend 1 minute observing or interacting with a creature out of Combat (or spend 1 AP in Combat) to learn information about its physical capabilities compared to your own. Choose one of the following stats of the creature to assess: Might, Agility, PD, PDR, and HP. Make a DC 10 Knowledge or Insight Check (your choice). 

* **Success:** You learn if the chosen stat is higher, lower, or the same as yours.

> **DC Tip:** If a creature is better than most at disguising or concealing their “true power” then the GM can increase the DC for this Feature to be used against it. The GM will not tell you if the DC is higher or if you roll higher than a 10 and still fail… they can lie about what information you gather.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Action Surge
Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 or more SP at any time to regain an amount of AP equal to the SP spent.

##### Second Wind
Once per Combat, when you take damage that would reduce you to Bloodied or lower, you immediately regain 2 SP and an amount of HP equal to your Prime Modifier. You regain this HP before the triggering damage.

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.
