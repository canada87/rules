## Monk

Monks are master martial artists that perfect their mind and bodies utilizing the ebb and flow of their inner energy. They use their body as a weapon and can enter into different stances that drastically change their combat abilities. 

**Source of Power:** Monks have become enlightened and are aware and in touch with their inner Ki energy, which they use to hone their bodies and minds. The journey to become a Monk could be through their own deep meditation, from being trained in a monastery, or from being mentored by a mysterious figure.
