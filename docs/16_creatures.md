### Creature Sizes

Creatures come in many different shapes and sizes ranging from a miniscule bug to a primordial titan and beyond. The number of Spaces a creature occupies determines its size for the purposes of rules that govern the interactions between creatures and their environment. The table below shows the 9 different creature sizes with examples for each and the number of Spaces they occupy.

| Size        | Examples                                  | Spaces                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Micro      | Spider See "Micro Creatures" below         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Tiny       | Cat                                        | 1/4 Space (4 per Space)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Small      | Sheep                                       | 1 Space                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Medium     | Human                                       | 1 Space                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Large      | Horse                                      | 4 Spaces: (2 x 2) or (4 x 1)                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Huge       | Elephant                                    | 9 Spaces: (3 x 3), (4 x 2), or (9 x 1)                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Gargantuan | T-Rex                                       | 16 Spaces: (4 x 4), (5 x 3), (8 x 2), or (16 x 1)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Colossal   | Brontosaurus                                | 25 Spaces: (5 x 5), (6 x 4), (8 x 3), (12 x 2), or (25 x 1)                                                                                                                                                                |

**Micro Creatures:** Exceptionally small creatures, such as Ants, can share their Space with other creatures. They can end their turn in a Space occupied by other creatures (and vice versa).

### Moving & Grappling Creatures

Creatures of different sizes have bonuses or penalties when attempting to Grapple, push, move, and knock other creatures Prone by both mundane and magical means.

*   If you are 1 or more sizes larger than your target, you have ADV on such Checks and Saves.
*   If you are 1 size smaller than your target, you have DisADV on such Checks and Saves.
*   If you are 2 or more sizes smaller than your target, they’re immune to such Checks and Saves.

> **DC Tip:** If a Medium sized Wizard is trying to move a Large sized creature with a *Telekinesis* Spell, the Wizard would have DisADV on the Check they make to move it. 

### Moving Through Creatures

While moving in Combat, there will be times when you’ll want or need to move through another creature’s Space. Whether the creature is friendly or hostile to you will determine whether or not you can freely move through their Space.

**Friendly Creatures:** You can move through a Space occupied by a friendly creature without having to spend any extra movement.

**Hostile Creatures:** You can move through the Space of hostile creatures that are 2 sizes larger or smaller than you, but you are considered to be Slowed while moving through the Space they occupy. If the creature is within 1 size of you, you can’t move through its Space unless you take the Pass Through Action (see "Pass Through" on page 45).

**Ending Your Movement:** You can’t end your turn in a Space that’s occupied by another creature.

### Collision

When a creature is thrown or knocked back and collides with an immovable object (such as a wall) or another creature, they take damage upon impact.

**Spaces:** A creature stops in the Space that it made contact with the object or creature.

**Damage:** A creature takes an amount of Bludgeoning damage equal to the number of Spaces it couldn’t travel due to the collision.

> **Example:** A creature is knocked back 5 Spaces and impacts a wall that’s only 2 Spaces away. The creature would be thrown 2 Spaces into the wall and then take 3 Bludgeoning damage for the 3 Spaces they couldn’t be moved. (5-2 = 3)

**Creature Collision:** If a thrown creature or falling creature collides with another creature, they share the damage (each takes half). (see "Shared Damage" on page 39).

> **DC Tip:** In order to hit a target creature with a thrown creature there is usually an Attack Check, Athletics Check, or Contest that needs to be made to make it happen. Otherwise, this would just be “automatic” damage to the target creature.

### Falling Attacks

If you want to put more force into an Attack Check, you can purposefully fall onto a target as part of your Attack Check. To do this you first need to move into a position to fall onto the target. Using the Creature Collision rules from above, you would count up the Spaces fallen and this number will represent the falling damage that will be taken. You can now make your Attack Check and resolve the damage based on the result. Then (regardless of if you hit or miss) you would share the damage taken from the fall. You would take half of the damage and the other half would be added to the damage they take as part of the same Attack Check.

> **Example:** If you jumped from 4 Spaces up, and your Attack Check deals 3 damage, then the creature would take 5 damage (3 from Attack and 2 from fall) and you would take 2 damage (from the fall).

### Throwing

#### Throwing Creatures

You can spend 1 AP to throw a creature that’s Grappled by you that’s the same size as you or smaller. Make an Athletics Check Contested by the target’s Martial Check. 

**Success:** You throw the creature up to a number of Spaces away from you equal to 1/2 of your Might (ending the Grappled Condition) + up to 1 additional Space for every 5 they fail the Contest by.

*   **Smaller Size:** If the creature is a size smaller than you, the distance thrown is equal to your Might (instead of half).
*   **Vertical Toss:** You can choose to throw the creature vertically into the air. When you do, the distance thrown is halved and it’s subjected to damage from Uncontrolled Falling (see “Uncontrolled Falling” on page 66).
*   **Team Throw:** If another creature has the same target Grappled, that other creature can spend 1 AP as a reaction to throw the target with you. You and the other creature each make an Athletics Check and add your results together to determine the total number of Spaces the target is thrown.
*   **Throw at a Target:** If you throw a creature at a target, you must make an Athletics Check and compare it to the target's PD. **Hit:** The thrown creature and the target share the Collision damage (each take half) (see "Shared Damage" on page 39). **Miss:** The thrown creature continues traveling up to the distance thrown or until it impacts an immovable object (such as a wall) and takes full Collision damage.

> **DC Tip:** Collision damage equals the number of Spaces it couldn’t travel (see “Collision” on page 70).

#### Throwing Objects

You can throw an object a number of Spaces depending on your Might and the object’s size. For the purposes of throwing objects, your minimum Might is 1. The table below shows how far you can throw each size of object:

| Object Size          | Spaces Thrown |
| :------------------- | :------------ |
| 2+ Sizes smaller   | 5 x Might     |
| 1 Size smaller      | Might         |
| Same Size           | 1/2 Might     |
| Larger              | Impossible     |

> **Example:** A Medium sized creature with a Might of 0 (minimum Might of 1) could throw a Tiny object up to 5 Spaces, a Small object 1 Space, and Medium object 1 Space (rounded up from 0.5). Conversely, if that creature had a Might of 6, they could throw a Tiny object 30 Spaces, a Small object 6 Spaces, and a Medium object 3 Spaces.

#### Throwing Melee Weapons

When you throw a Melee Weapon that lacks the Toss or Thrown property as part of an Attack Check, the Weapon deals 1/2 its normal damage. The range of a Melee Weapon that lacks the Toss or Thrown property is 1/5. (see “Equipment” on page 73).

> **DC Tip:** Basically ALL Weapons have a default range of 1/5 (unless otherwise stated). This means within 1 Space you can make an Attack Check with no penalties and deal full damage with the weapon, but between 2 and 5 Spaces away your Attack now has DisADV and the total damage that it deals is cut in half.

### Improvised Weapons

Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapons deals 1 damage of a type determined by the GM. When making an Attack Check with an Improvised Weapon you only add your Prime Modifier to your d20 roll, you don’t add your Combat Mastery.

**Weapon Style:** Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapon doesn’t benefit from Weapon Styles or Weapon Properties.

> **DC Tip:** If an Improvised Weapon is similar enough to an actual weapon, the GM might decide that it could gain certain Weapon Properties or even a Weapon Style.

### Unarmed Strikes

Unarmed Strikes deal 0 Bludgeoning damage. An Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack made using any part of a creature’s own body, such as a punch, elbow, kick, knee, or headbutt.

> **DC Tip:** Attacks that deal 0 base damage can still benefit from bonus damage, such as Heavy Hits, Power Attack Maneuvers, Class Features, etc.

### Non-Lethal Attacks

When you make a Melee Attack with a Weapon or Unarmed Strike, you can declare the Attack to be Non-Lethal. If a creature is reduced to 0 HP or lower by a Non-Lethal Attack, they’re knocked Unconscious instead and are considered Stable for the purposes of Death’s Door.

If a creature is knocked Unconscious in this way, another creature can spend 1 AP to shake them awake. When the creature awakens, they’re on Death’s Door at 0 HP, regardless of how much damage was dealt by the Non-Lethal Attack.

### Dual Wielding

When you are wielding a Weapon in each hand, no Weapons, or some combination of either, you’re considered to be Dual Wielding. While Dual Wielding, when you make an Attack with one hand followed by a second Attack with the other hand, the second Attack ignores the Multiple Check Penalty. You can ignore the Multiple Check Penalty in this way once per turn.

> **DC Tip:** If you have Mastery with Light Shields, you can use a Light Shield in place of a Weapon for the purposes of Dual Wielding.

### Flanking

You gain an additional +2 to your Melee Martial Attack if your target is Flanked. A creature is Flanked when it has 2 or more enemies within 1 Space of it that are not adjacent to each other, provided they aren’t Incapacitated or Prone.

### Hidden Creatures

Creatures that are Unseen or Unheard are more difficult to discover.

#### Unseen

Creatures that can’t see you are Exposed (your Attacks against them have ADV) and Hindered against you (they have DisADV on Attacks against you). You are Unseen by a creature while you are imperceivable to its visual senses, such as when you’re Fully Concealed, you’re Invisible, or it’s Blinded.

> **DC Tip:** If you are Unseen because you’re behind Full Cover, affected by the *Invisibility* Spell, and your target is Blinded, you don’t gain the benefits of being Unseen multiple times. You are either Unseen or not.

#### Unheard

You are Unheard while you remain silent, talk no louder than a whisper, or are within an area affected by the *Silence* Spell or a similar effect.

#### Hidden

You are Hidden from a creature while you’re both Unseen and Unheard by it. Your location is unknown to creatures you’re Hidden from.

> **DC Tip:** If you become Hidden to a creature that’s aware of you, it only knows your last location known to it before you became Hidden. Creatures that can detect your presence, even through magical means such as divination, are not considered to know your location, see, or hear you unless the Feature says so otherwise.

### Underwater Combat

While underwater, creatures are subjected to the following conditions:

*   **Attack Penalties:** Martial Attacks are made with DisADV using Weapons that aren’t Crossbow or Spears. Creatures with a Swim Speed ignore this penalty. Additionally, Ranged Attacks automatically miss targets beyond the Weapon’s normal range.
*   **Holding Breath:** Creatures that attempt to speak while holding their breath underwater, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component require to cast a Spell, reduce their Breath Duration by 1 (see “Holding Your Breath” on page 66).
*   **Fire Resistance:** Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have Fire Resistance (Half).
