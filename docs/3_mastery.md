## Mastery & Training

Mastery represents your level of competency within different
categories. When you have Mastery with something (such
as a Skill, Trade, or Language), you gain certain bonuses to
actions that use that Mastery. Conversely, when you lack
Mastery with something you may suffer certain penalties
(such as adding no bonuses to those rolls).

### Mastery Types

There are several types of Mastery:

* **Skill Mastery:** Your Mastery with certain skill sets, such
as Awareness, Stealth, and Investigation. These are Skills
used to interact with the environment and the creatures
that inhabit it.
* **Trade Mastery:** Your Mastery with certain professions,
such as Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Artistry.
These are Trades used to craft goods and provide services.
* **Language Mastery:** Your fluency with certain Languages.
This Mastery is used to govern how well you can read,
write, speak, and understand different Languages.
* **Combat Mastery:** Your prowess on the battlefield, such
as Attacks, Defenses, and Saves. This Mastery represents
your general ability to fight and survive against other
creatures.

#### Gaining Masteries

You can gain Mastery from your Class, Class Features,
Subclass Features, Ancestry Traits, or Talents. You’ll have
opportunities at character creation and when your PC
levels up to select a variety of options to gain any of the
above Mastery Types.

### Skill Mastery

Skill Mastery represents your proficiency with a Skill.
There are several Skill Mastery Levels, ranging from
Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Skill
Mastery grants greater bonuses to the Skill Checks in
which you have Mastery (see Skills for more information
on the different Skills).

#### Skill Mastery Levels & Limits

There are 5 Skill Mastery Levels. Each Skill Mastery Level
grants you a +2 bonus on the respective Skill Checks. Your
Skill Mastery Limit starts at Novice and increases based on
your Character Level as shown in the table below.

| Character Level | Mastery Limit | Mastery Bonus |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1               | Novice        | +2            |
| 5               | Adept         | +4            |
| 10              | Expert        | +6            |
| 15              | Master        | +8            |
| 20              | Grandmaster   | +10           |

> **Example 1:** If you have 2 Skill Mastery Levels in the Athletics
Skill (Adept), you add a +4 bonus (+2 per Level) to any
Athletics Check you make. See Checks & Saves for more
information on making Skill Checks.

> **Example 2:** If a PC has a Skill Mastery Limit of Adept, they
can allocate up to 2 Skill Points into a single Skill, such as
the Awareness Skill. If that PC has additional Skill Points to
allocate, they can’t allocate them into the Awareness Skill
until their Skill Mastery Limit increases to Expert or higher.

#### Gaining Skill Mastery

You can increase your Skill Mastery Level from Skill Points
or from certain Traits, Features, or Talents.

Mastery based on chosen Feature options.
* **Ancestry Skills:** Some Ancestries (such as Humans) grant
Skill Mastery.

##### Skill Points

You can spend Skill Points to increase your Skill Mastery
Level in a given Skill, up to your Skill Mastery Limit. You
gain Skill Points from your Background, Class, Intelligence,
and possibly from Talents you choose.

Points.
* **Class Skills:** All Classes grant additional Skill Points
based on your Level.
* **Talent Skills:** Some Talents (such as Skill Increase) grant
additional Skill Points.
* **Intelligence Skills:** You gain a number of Skill Points equal
to your Intelligence. If your Intelligence is negative, then
your total Skill Points is reduced by the same amount. If
your Intelligence changes, your total Skill Points change
by an equal amount.

##### Increasing your Skill Mastery Limit

Some Ancestry Traits, Class Features, and Talents can
increase your Skill Mastery Limit. A Skill can only
benefit from 1 bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit at a time.
When your Skill Mastery Limit increases at the normal
level, it continues to be benefit from the bonus to its Skill
Mastery Limit.

> **Example 1:** The Skill Mastery Limit of a Level 1 PC is Novice.
If that PC is a Human, they can take the Human Ancestry
Trait: Skill Expertise, which increases the Skill Mastery Limit
of 1 Skill of their choice. If they choose the Awareness Skill,
the Skill Mastery Limit of the Awareness raises from Novice
to Adept. If that PC gains another Trait, Feature, or Talent
that increases their Skill Mastery Limit, then Awareness won’t
benefit from it because it’s Skill Mastery Limit has already
been increased beyond its normal level.

> **Example 2:** A Level 1 PC has a Skill Mastery Limit of Novice. If
it gains a bonus to its Skill Mastery Limit (such as through the
Roguish Finesse Feature), it’s Skill Mastery Limit increases to
Adept. When its Skill Mastery Increases normally at Level 5,
its Skill Mastery Limit increases to Expert.

###### Skill Points to increase Skill Mastery Limit

You can increase your Skill Mastery using Skill Points.
Choose a Skill. You can spend 1 Skill Point to increase
its Skill Mastery Limit by 1. You must still spend another

Mastery in the Influence Skill. Then they spend 1 Skill Point
to increase their Skill Mastery Limit in Influence from Novice
to Adept and an additional Skill Point to increase their Skill
Mastery Level in Influence also to Adept. In total, they spent 3
Skill Points to raise their Skill Mastery Level with the Influence
Skill from having no Skill Mastery to now having Adept
Skill Mastery.

or Talent that increases their Trade Mastery Limit, then
Gaming won’t benefit from it because it’s Trade Mastery Limit
has already been increased beyond its normal level.

Language. There are only 2 Language Mastery Levels:
Limited and Fluent. See Languages for more information
on the different Languages.

You can spend Trade Points (see Trade Mastery above) to

up to the maximum Language Mastery Level of 2 (Fluent).

| Mastery Level |  Fluency                                                                                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 - None      | You don't know the language.                                                                          |

| 2 - Fluent    | You can read, write, and speak the language fluently.                                                 |

> **Example:** If you have 1 level of Language Mastery (Limited) in the Goblin Language, then you can make a Language Check to attempt to read, write, speak, or understand the Goblin Language. Alternatively, 2 levels of Language Mastery (Fluent) would allow you to do so without needing to make a Check. See **Checks & Saves** for more information on making Language Checks.

**DC Tip:** There is more of a progression to learning a language and there are more subtle interactions that happen both from a roleplay standpoint and a mechanics standpoint.
