affected by it at all. The source of a creature’s Condition
Resistance, Immunity or Vulnerability can be attained from
a Class Feature, Ancestry Trait, Magic Item, Spell, etc.

against the Condition.

## Condition Stacking & Overlapping

Certain Conditions can stack multiple times, increasing
the potency of the Condition’s effects on the target.
Other Conditions overlap, keeping the same potency but
becoming more restrictive.

### Stacking Conditions

A target can be affected by a Condition with an X value
multiple times. If you gain multiple stacks of the same
Condition, you add their X values together. If a stacking
Condition doesn’t include an X value, the value equals 1.

> **Example:** If you were Exposed and another effect imposed
the Exposed Condition on you again, you would become
Exposed 2, causing Attacks against you to have ADV 2 (roll 3
d20s and take the highest).

*Durations:* When a creature is subjected to the same
Condition multiple times but with different durations, it’s
important to keep track of the source of each Condition so
you know when each Condition ends.

> **Example:** You might be Exposed against the next Attack
against you, Exposed until the end of your next turn, and
Exposed for 1 minute, all at the same time. These effects
stack, but you need to track them independently to make sure
you know how “Exposed” you currently are.

### Overlapping Conditions

A target can be effected by each of the following Condition
multiple times, but the effects of the same Condition don’t
stack on the target.

#### Charmed
A creature can be Charmed by more than 1 creature at
a time, each of them gaining ADV on Charisma Checks
against the target. However, a creature that Charms a target
more than once only gains the effects of the Charmed
Condition once.

> **Example:** A creature doesn’t have ADV 2 on Charisma
Checks against a target they’ve Charmed twice. They only
have ADV 1 on Charisma Checks against the target.

#### Frightened
A creature can be Frightened by more than 1 creature at
a time, suffering DisADV on Checks while any source that
Frightened it within its sight and unable to move towards
any source that Heavily Intimidated it within its sight.
However, a Frightened creature only suffers the effects of
the Frightened Condition once.

> **Example:** A creature doesn’t have DisADV 2 on Checks
while 2 sources that are Frightening it are in sight. They
only have DisADV 1 on Checks, regardless of the number of
sources in sight.

#### Restrained
A creature that is Restrained by more than 1 creature
only suffers the effects of the Restrained Condition once.
However, a creature Restrained by multiple sources
will remain Restrained until they are free from being
Restrained by all sources.

#### Taunted
A creature that is Taunted by multiple creatures does
not have DisADV on their Attacks against creatures that
Taunted them. They can only move away from any
creature that Taunted them if they are moving towards
another creature that Taunted them.

> **Example:** If a Goblin is Taunted by a Hunter, then later
becomes Taunted by a Champion, the Goblin can only move
away from the Hunter if they are approaching the Champion
and can Attack both normally.

#### Terrified

A creature can be Terrified by more than 1 source at a time.

> **Example:** If a creature is surrounded by multiple sources,
they are unable to move and can only take the Dodge Action.

#### Tethered

A creature that is Tethered by more than 1 effect, must
remain within reach of all the specified Tethers.

> **Example:** If a creature is Tethered 5 Spaces by one effect,
and then Tethered 5 Spaces by another effect, it can’t move
farther than 5 Spaces from either Tether.

#### Excluded Conditions

The following Conditions don’t stack or overlap in any
way: Blinded, Deafened, Immobilized, Incapacitated,
Invisible, Paralyzed, Petrified, Surprised, and
Unconscious.
