## Skills, Trades & Languages

### Skills

Skills are representative of a creature's ability to perform certain activities. If two creatures are wrestling each other, they can use the Athletics Skill to compete against each other. Every Skill is tied to an Attribute (Might, Agility, Intelligence, or Charisma). Each Skill represents an aspect of an Attribute, such as Athletics being an aspect of a creature's Might Attribute, or Acrobatics with its Agility Attribute. The Awareness Skill uses your Prime Attribute, which is your highest Attribute.

**DC Tip:** There are countless ways to use these Skills, especially when you use the "Variable Attribute Rule" (see Checks and Saves section). You can really get outside the box by combining Skill with different Attributes.
