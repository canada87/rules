## Rogue

Rogues are skilled, evasive, and cunning. They impose
conditions onto enemies, then exploit those weaknesses to
inflict even more harm.

**Source of Power:** Rogues can pinpoint and take advantage
of the weaknesses of their enemies and use their nimbleness
and cunning to get what they want, in combat and out.
They could learn this from being a petty thief, a former
noble, or an assassin in training.

* Hit a Flanked target.
* Hit a target that’s affected by a Condition.
* Once per turn, when you gain the benefits of Cunning Action.

##### Debilitating Strike
When you make an Attack with a Weapon, you can spend
1 SP to force the target to make a Physical Save against
your Save DC. Save Failure: Until the start of your next
turn, the target suffers 1 of the following effects of your
choice: Deafened, Exposed, Hindered, or Slowed 2.
A target can’t be affected by the same option more than

to Grandmaster (+10). A Skill can only benefit from one
increase to its Mastery limit.
* **Multi-Skilled:** You gain 1 Skill Point.

##### Cypher Speech (Flavor Feature)
You become Fluent in a Mortal Language of your choice.
Additionally, you understand how to speak in code with
a specific demographic of your choice (such as upper
society, lower society, a faction, etc.). Your coded messages
can be concealed in normal conversation and written
communications. This allows you to leave simple messages
such as “Safety” , “Threat” , or “Wealth” , or mark the
location of a cache, a secret passageway, a safehouse, or an
area of danger.

> **DC Tip:** DC Tip: This could be anything from the slang of the slums,
to the fancy language of the upper classes. It could even be
more specific as some kind of bizarre double speak between
twin siblings or between the political elite. If the Player
doesn’t know what to choose for this, they can always defer
to a generic thieves guild option.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Cheap Shot
You deal +1 damage on Martial Attacks against creatures that are Flanked or subjected to at least 1 Condition.

> **DC Tip:** While Unseen, creatures are Exposed to you (your Attacks against them have ADV) and Hindered against you (they have DisADV on Attacks).

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.

## SubClasses

### SubClass: Long Death

#### Thousand Cuts

When a creature fails its Save against your Debilitating
Strike, it also begins Bleeding (even if it’s immune to the
Condition). Bleeding caused in this way:

* Doesn’t end when the target regains HP.
* The DC to end the Condition is equal to your Save DC.
* Can stack multiple times, dealing True damage equal to
the number of stacks. If a creature succeeds a Medicine
Check to remove Bleeding, they remove 1 additional
stack for every 5 they succeed by.

> **DC Tip:** These Rogues are able to apply magic or alchemical
toxins to their blades that eat away at their targets over time,
even things like Elementals or Undead that don’t have blood.
The specific narrative reasoning is up to you.

#### Hundred Ways to Die (Flavor Feature)
You are an expert at studying and identifying weaknesses in
bodies and how best to kill creatures. You have ADV on any
Check made to determine how something died or could die
easier. This also extends to poisons, toxins, or identifying
other materials used to kill.

while taking advantage of their openings. You gain the
following benefits:

* **Flourishes:** Your Cunning Action now also includes the
Disarm and Dodge Actions.
* **Taunting Shot:** Once on each of your turns when you
make an Attack against a creature with a Condition, you
can forgo your Cheap Shot damage to force the target to
make a Charisma Save. Failure: The target is Taunted
until the end of your next turn.
* **Riposte:** When a creature within your Melee Range
misses you with an Attack, it provokes an Opportunity
Attack from you.

#### Tall Tales (Flavor Feature)

You know how to play to a crowd. You can spend up to 5
minutes telling a story to a crowd of creatures (that are not
immediately hostile to you) and keep their rapt attention
the entire time. During this story, creatures within the
crowd have DisADV on Awareness Checks.

> **DC Tip:** A creature with DisADV on Awareness would have a
-5 penalty to their Passive Awareness.

### SubClass: Paragon Rogue

Your mastery over unseen attacks grants you the
following benefits:

* **Skulker:** You have ADV on Stealth Checks made in

their Saves against your Debilitating Strikes.

#### Sinister Shot

*Requirements:* Cheap Shot, Level 3

Your Cheap Shot deals +1 damage for each additional
Condition on the target. Multiple stacks of the same
Condition count only once.

> **DC Tip:** Nested Conditions aren’t considered separate
Conditions on the target. For example, a creature with the
Prone Condition isn’t considered Exposed or Hindered
for the purposes of this Feature, unless they’re Exposed or
Hindered by other effects.
