## Cleric

Clerics can reach out and call upon the power of a deity
to aid them in battle and to support them and their allies.
Clerics can range from a knowledgeable priest, to a knight
in holy armor. They reach out to heir deity to empower
their magic in ways mortals normally cannot.

**Source of Power:** Clerics have a relationship with a powerful
deity, or deities, that they are in service to. Through their
faith, they’re granted magical power by their deity. They
could serve a good god of life that grants them healing
magic, or an evil god of death that grants them abilities to
end life.

* **Divine Damage:** Choose an Elemental or Mystical damage type. The chosen damage type becomes your Divine Damage which is used for some Cleric Features.
* **Divine Domain:** You gain the benefits of 2 Divine Domains of your choice.

> **DC Tip:** Divine Domains are a great way to pick the kind of
deity you want to serve. If you pick Life and Fire, perhaps you
serve a phoenix themed god of flames and rebirth.

##### Domains

*Knowledge Domain*

Your Mastery Limit increases by 1 for all Knowledge Skills.
A Skill can only benefit from 1 Feature that increases
its Mastery Limit at a time. Additionally, you gain 2
Skill Points.

Divine Domain multiple times.

least 1 creature, you can restore 1 HP to 1 creature of your
choice within 1 Space of you (including yourself).

Light and are Hindered on their next Attack.

*Dark Domain*

Your mastery over shadows grants you supernatural sight
and the ability to hide yourself from other creatures. You

Spaces of you makes a Check, you can spend 1 AP as a
Reaction to remove all instances of ADV and DisADV
from that Check.

*Chaos Domain*

When you make a Spell Check you can choose to give
yourself ADV on it, but you must also roll on the Wild
Magic Table. You can use this Feature once per Long
Rest, and regain the ability to use it again when you roll
for Initiative.

* You can’t be Flanked.
* When you spend MP, you gain the ability to see Invisible
creatures and objects until the start of your next turn.

*Trickery Domain*

When you produce an MP Effect that targets at least 1
creature, you can choose 1 of the targets and create an
illusory duplicate of it that lasts until the start of your next
turn. The next Attack made against the target has DisADV,
and causes the illusory duplicate to disappear.

*Ancestral Domain*

You get 2 Ancestry Points that you can spend on Traits
from any Ancestry.

##### Divine Blessing
You can spend 1 AP to say a prayer and petition your deity
for their divine blessing. Choose 1 of the blessings listed
below. Each blessing has a listed MP cost that you must
spend to gain the blessing. Once during the next minute,
you can apply the blessing to a Spell you cast. If your Spell
targets more than 1 creature, the blessing only applies to 1
target of your choice.

* **Destruction:** (1 MP) The target takes 3 Divine damage,
provided that the result of your Spell Check is equal to or
higher than the target’s MD. If the Spell doesn’t normally
require a Spell Check, then you must make one when
you apply this blessing.

they can add to 1 Check of their choice they make within
the next minute.
* **Restoration:** (1 MP) The target regains 3 HP.

**Unused Blessing:** You can only have 1 blessing at a time.
If you petition your deity for a blessing while you already
have a blessing, the first blessing immediately ends without
granting any benefit. If the blessing ends without granting
any benefit, you regain the MP spent to gain the blessing.

##### Divine Omen (Flavor Feature)
Once per Long Rest, you can spend 10 minutes to communewith your Deity.

* **Question:** You can ask them 1 question, which must be posed in a way that could be answered with a yes or no.
* **Response:** The deity responds to the best of their knowledge and intentions in one of the following responses: Yes, No, or Unclear. 
A response of Unclear could come from the deity not knowing the answer, wanting to purposefully keep it a secret, the question being phrased in a confusing or complicated way, or there not being a simple answer to the question.

> **Example:** The response could be audible (a formless voice),
visual (words that appear in the sky or on a book), symbolic
(images and shapes telling a story). The answer could be
delivered by a creature (random animal or human becomes
possessed and starts talking), in your surroundings (talking
flames, whispering wind, moving objects), within your own
mind (a dream or vision), or by any other means they want.

> **DC Tip:** Regardless of how the answer is given, it should be clear to the PLAYER what the answer was.

* **Casting this Spell Again:** If you commune with your deity more than once per Long Rest, you must make a DC 15 Spell Check. Failure: You receive no answer. Each time you commune again before you complete a Long Rest, the DC increases by 5.
