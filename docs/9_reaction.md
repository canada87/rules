# Reactions

Reactions are Actions that a creature can take during another creature’s turn. A creature can’t take a Reaction on their own turn, unless the Reaction allows them to do so in response to another creature’s Reaction. Reactions are not affected by the Multiple Check Penalty.

## Taking a Reaction

A creature can take a Reaction on another creature’s turn provided it meets the requirements to do so. The requirements to take a Reaction are listed in the Reaction’s Prerequisite and Trigger statements. You can only take 1 Reaction per Trigger.

> **Example 1:** When a creature leaves a Martial PC’s reach, they would only be able to make 1 Opportunity Attack against the creature (they could still spend AP to perform Attack Maneuvers with their Opportunity Attack).

> **Example 2:** When an Attack is made within 1 Space of a Martial PC, the PC could take the Parry Maneuver against the Attack (1st trigger). If the Attack still Hits (2nd trigger), the PC could take the Protect Maneuver to share the damage with the target.

## Reaction Requirements

* **Prerequisite:** A prerequisite states the Feature (Martial Feature, Spellcasting Feature, or a different Feature) required to gain access to the Reaction.
* **Trigger:** A trigger states the conditions that must be met in order for a creature to take the Reaction.

## Spending Resources

If a Reaction has a resource cost (Action Points, Mana Points, Stamina Points, etc.), a creature must spend those resources to take the Reaction.

* **Regaining Resources:** Reactions give a creature an opportunity to spend Action Points during another creature’s turn. If a creature spends Action Points, then they’ll have less Action Points to spend on their next turn. Any Action Points spent are not regained until the end of a creature's turn.

> **Example:** If you take a Reaction to spend 1 Action Point, on your next turn you’ll only have 3 Action Points to use (4 -1 = 3).

> **DC Tip:** If you somehow manage to spend all 4 of your AP before your turn, then you’d have 0 AP at the start of your next turn. You wouldn’t be able to do anything, so your turn would immediately end and you would get your 4 AP back.

* **Multiple Reactions:** A creature can spend Action Points to take multiple Reactions provided they meet all the conditions and can spend enough resources to do so.

## Types of Reactions

### Opportunity Attack

**Prerequisite:** Martial Mastery

**Trigger:** A creature you can see within your Melee Range uses its movement to leave your Melee Range, stands up from Prone, picks up an item off the ground, or takes the Object Action.

**Reaction:** You can spend 1 AP to make a Melee Martial Attack against the provoking creature. You can spend additional AP to gain ADV or to perform Maneuvers with the Attack.

### Spell Duel

**Prerequisite:** Spellcasting Mastery

**Trigger:** When another creature that you can see casts a Spell.

> **DC Tip:** Remember that MP Effects (such as a Druid’s Nature’s Veil Feature) count as Spells for the purposes of Spell Duels and Combo Spellcasting.

**Reaction:** You declare a Spell Duel and spend 2 AP and 1 or more MP to challenge the creature with a Spell of your own. You can declare a Spell Duel after the creature makes its Spell Check but before you know the result of its Check. 

> **DC Tip:** Once a Spell Duel is declared, the opponent can’t change their declared Spell or modify their Spell Check in any way.

**Multiple Participants:** Additional creatures can choose to participate in helping the Spell take effect or participate in stopping the Spell from taking effect. If multiple creatures choose to participate in the Spell Duel, the participants are sorted into Initiators (those trying to help the Spell take effect) and Challengers (those trying to prevent the Spell from taking effect). During the Contest (see further below), every participant makes their Spell Check and the highest Initiator result is compared against the highest Challenger result to determine the outcome.

**Choosing a Spell**

You declare which Spell you’re using to challenge the opposing Spell, and then describe how you do so using your Spell. The GM decides if that makes sense.

> **DC Tip:** You’re not actually casting the Spell as stated in its description. You’re instead using the “flavor” of the Spell to represent how you initiate the Spell Duel. The only part of the Spell’s mechanics that matter is its Range and/or Area of Effect.

* **Targeted:** If your chosen Spell targets 1 or more creatures or objects, you must be able to target the opposing creature or any of its targets with your Spell.
* **Area of Effect:** If your chosen Spell covers an area (such as an Arc, Cone, Cube, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere), then your Spell’s Area of Effect must include the opposing creature, any of its targets, or cover an area between the opposing creature and any of its targets.
* **Success & Failure:** The success and failure statements of your Spell are replaced by the success and failure statements in the Contest section below.

**Contest**

The Spell Check the opposing creature makes to cast its Spell is Contested by the Spell Check you make to cast your Spell. When comparing the Spell Checks for the purpose of determining the winner of the Contest, each creature gains a bonus to its Check equal to the MP it spent on its Spell.

* **Success:** The target creature’s Spell fails and has no effect.
* **Failure:** The target creature’s Spell succeeds and takes effect.
* **Tie:** The target creature’s Spell fails, has no effect, and you each roll on the Wild Magic Surge Table. The effect from the table lasts until the end of your next turn.

Whatever the result, each creature still spends all AP, MP, or other resources they spent to cast their Spell.

> **Spell Duel Walkthrough Example:** An enemy says they’re casting Scorching Ray at one of your allies. You shout out, “Spell Duel!” You choose your Cone of Cold Spell and are in range of an area between the enemy and your ally. You describe ice blasting out of your hands to try and intercept the fiery projectiles. You then spend 2 AP and choose to spend 3 MP for the Spell Duel. The enemy caster Makes their Spell Check in the same way that they would if you had done nothing. You also make your Spell Check and then both you and the enemy caster get a bonus to your roll equal to the MP spent. You compare your results together and see what happens as your magics collide midair.

> **DC Tip:** Get creative with your Spells and think of cool descriptions. See the examples below for increasingly creative ways to use your Spells… BUT it’s always at the GM’s discretion. Some of these examples might not be allowed by your GM. The examples below show different ways that the “range requirement” can be met, but as long as you are in range of either the caster, their targets, or a space between the two.

> **Creative Example 1:** An enemy casts a Lightning Bolt at an ally. You choose your Wall of Earth Spell and are in range of an area between the enemy and your ally. You describe rocks forming a wall between them and your ally attempting to block the lightning.

> **Creative Example 2:** An enemy casts Poison Cloud at an area. You choose your Gust Spell and are in range of at least one ally inside of the affected area. You describe a rush of wind shooting out from you to blow away the noxious cloud.

> **Creative Example 3:** An enemy casts Disintegrate at an ally. You choose your Dissonant Whispers Spell and are in range of the enemy caster. You describe entering their mind, giving them hallucinations that they’ve already cast the spell.

> **Creative Example 4:** An enemy casts Fireball at an area. You choose your Calm Emotions Spell and are in range of the enemy caster. You describe attempting to change their emotions to be chill and relaxed so they won’t want to hurt anyone anymore. Your GM says, “That makes no sense,” and you now have to pick some other Spell or the enemy’s Spell goes off as intended.
