## Wizard

Wizards learn to master each of the Spell Schools to control
them in a structured and efficient way. They utilize sigils
on the ground to enhance certain types of magic while they
push spells to their limits.

**Source of Power:** Wizards learn to use magic from a
dedicated study of the arcane through practicing lessons
and reading tomes. This knowledge could come from a
wizard school they attend, a family tome that has been
passed down through the generations, or even from a spell
book they stole and just kept practicing with.

### Wizard Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Spell School Initiate

You’ve completed training in a specialized School of Magic.
Choose a Spell School. You gain the following benefits:

* **School Magic:** You learn 1 Arcane Cantrip and 1 Arcane
Spell from this Spell School.
* **Signature School:** When you cast a Spell from the chosen
School, you can reduce its MP cost by 1. Its total MP cost
before the reduction still can’t exceed your Mana Spend
Limit. You can use this Feature once per Long Rest, but
regain the ability to use it again when you roll for Initiative.

##### Arcane Sigil

You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to create a 1 Space diameter
Arcane Sigil on the ground beneath you that lasts for 1
minute. When you create an Arcane Sigil choose 1 Spell
School (Enchantment, Necromancy, Protection, etc.) or
1 Spell Tag (Fire, Cold, Teleportation, etc.). The Arcane
Sigil radiates magic of the chosen type.

* **Using a Sigil:** While a creature is within the area of your
Arcane Sigil, it has ADV on Spell Checks to cast or produce
the effects of Spells with the chosen Spell School or Spell
Tag.
* **Moving a Sigil:** You can spend 1 AP to teleport one of your
Sigils within 10 spaces to your current space, but multiple
Sigils can’t coexist in the same Space.

#### Ritual Caster (Flavor Feature)

You learn 1 Arcane Spell with the Ritual Spell Tag each
time you gain a Wizard Class Feature (including this one).
You can only gain this benefit once per Level.

Additionally, when you encounter an Arcane Spell with
the Ritual Spell Tag in a form you can study (such as a
spellbook, a spell scroll, or from an instructor), you can
spend a number of hours equal to the Spell’s base MP cost
to learn it.

You can only cast Spells you learn with this feature as
Rituals, unless you learned it from another source.

---

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Prepared Spell

When you complete a Long Rest, choose 1 Spell you
know. The chosen Spell becomes your Prepared Spell
until your next Long Rest. Your Prepared Spell gains the
following benefits:

* **Mana Limit Break:** When you cast this Spell, you can
increase your Mana Spend Limit by 1. You can use this
Feature once per Long Rest, but you regain the ability to
use it when you roll for Initiative.
* **Rehearsed Casting:** During a Spell Duel, Challengers have
DisADV on Spell Checks to stop your Spell.

## SubClasses

### SubClass: Portal Mage

#### Portal Magic

When you use your Arcane Sigil Feature, you can spend
1 additional MP to create 1 intangible Arcane Portal in a
Space you can see within 10 Spaces that is linked to the
Sigil. The Portal disappears when its linked Arcane Sigil
ends. It grants the following benefits:

* **Arcane Portal:** Creatures of your choice within 1 Space
of the Sigil or Portal can spend 1 Space of Movement to
teleport to an unoccupied Space within 1 Space of the
linked Sigil or Portal.

> **DC Tip:** Teleportation doesn’t provoke Opportunity Attacks.

* **Linked Magic:** While within 1 Space of the Sigil or Portal,
you can cast a Spell or make an Attack as if you were
standing in the Space of the linked Sigil or Portal. When
you do, you gain the benefits of the Arcane Sigil, regardless
of where you’re standing.
* **Teleportation Expert:** When you learn a new Spell, you can
choose any Spell with the Teleportation Spell Tag.

#### Portal Sage (Flavor Feature)

You have ADV on Checks to learn about the Astromancy
Spell School (such as Teleportation magic or Portals).
Additionally, if you spend 1 minute observing a portal or
teleportation runes, you can make a DC 10 Spell Check to
try to understand the inner mechanism of a Portal within 5
Spaces. Success: You learn where it leads to and for how
long it has been open. Success (5): You learn how to activate
and deactivate it (such as its passphrase, procedures, or any
required special item).

---

### SubClass: Witch

#### Coven’s Gift

You learn 1 Spell of your choice with the Curse Spell Tag.
When you learn a new Spell, you can choose any Spell with
the Curse Spell Tag. Spells with the Curse Spell Tag count
as being part of your chosen Spell School for the purposes
of your Spell School Initiate Feature.

> **Beta Note:** DC20 will receive an overhaul of its Spellcasting
(and Maneuvers/Techniques) systems in Beta 0.10. Until then,
the following Spells are considered to have the Curse Spell
Tag: Bane, Befriend, Death Bolt, and Poison Bolt.

##### Hex Enhancements

You gain the Spell Enhancements listed below, which
you can add to any Spell you cast. You can only use 1 of
these Spell Enhancements per Spell you cast. MP spent
on these Spell Enhancements doesn’t count against your
Mana Spend Limit. When you use one of these Spell
Enhancements, 1 creature of your choice that’s targeted
by the Spell must make a Repeated Charisma Save against
your Spell Check. If the Spell doesn’t normally require a
Spell Check, you must make one when using one of these
Spell Enhancements. Save Failure: The target is subjected
to the chosen Hex effects for 1 minute:

* **Bewitching Hex:** (1 MP) The target becomes Charmed by
you for the duration.
* **Reaping/Life Hex:** (1 MP) The target takes 1 True damage
and you regain 1 HP. This effect repeats at the end of each
of its turns for the duration.
* **Vermin Hex:** (1 MP) The target can’t speak and if its Size is
Large or smaller its Size decreases by 1. Its Size decreases
by 1 again at the end of each of its turns for the duration
until it’s tiny.

> **DC Tip:** You could flavor this as the target slowly turning into
a toad or other tiny creature.

#### Curse Expert (Flavor Feature)

You can spend 1 minute focusing your mind to detect the
presence of Curses within 20 Spaces. You learn the location
of any Cursed creature or Cursed object within range. If
you spend 10 minutes in contact with a Cursed creature
or object, you learn the nature of the Curse but not the
knowledge of how to remove it.
