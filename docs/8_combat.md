## Action Points
You have Actions Points (AP) which you can spend in Combat. You can spend AP on Actions, Reactions, or Features, such as Maneuvers, Cantrip Enhancements, Class Features, and Ancestry Features. Your Action Point maximum is 4.

**Gaining AP:** At the start of Combat, each creature gains a number of Actions Points equal to its AP Maximum. Once an Action Point is spent, it can’t be used again until it’s regained. 

**Regaining AP:** You regain all spent Action Points when your turn ends.

> **DC Tip:** Remember, you get all of your AP back at the end of your turn, so make sure you spend all of your AP before your turn ends.

### AP Outside of Combat
Action Points can’t be spent outside of Combat. Instead, a creature declares what Action it’ll take and performs that Action. A creature can’t take an Action that has an AP cost higher than the creature’s AP maximum.

**Longer Actions:** If the AP cost of the Action is greater than 4, the GM might require the creature to spend more time than normal to complete the Action. 

When a PC takes the Help Action outside of Combat, it grants another creature a d8. The PC can’t take another Action until the GM says enough time has passed to do so. The GM might wait until all PCs have taken an Action before allowing the PC to use the Help Action (or different Action) again.

> **Example:** Your group is getting ready for a big event (heist, performance or even a Combat or Skill Challenge, etc). Each party member describes what Skill Check they’re about to do. The Bard of the group can’t go up to each PC and take multiple Help Actions to grant multiple Help Dice to each of them. They can only do one… unless the Checks being made are separated in time enough, and the GM allows the multiple instances of Help if it makes sense. 

> **DC Tip:** Basically Combat is more strict and structured in both turn order (Initiative) and in how much you can do at a time (4 Action Points per Round of Combat). If you’re not in Combat, everything is more fluid and free form.

    Combat in DC20 is a time when PCs are pushed to their absolute limit; a time when they rise to the occasion, often surprising themselves with what they’re capable of doing. The way this is represented mechanically is by allowing players to spend AP in order to apply stacking ADV to significant rolls made during the most dire of situations. This perfectly reflects real life experiences of a “mother's strength” to rescue her child from a car or an athlete's propensity for performing best during the real event instead of in practice.

    There are many ways to justify why PCs are more capable and reliable within combat: adrenaline coursing through their system, pressure to succeed as failure isn't an option, or even excitement and other endorphins fueling their performance or putting them in a state of flow. Regardless of which of these you choose to substantiate this change in success rate, there’s one more consideration to keep in mind.

    DC20 is a game with mechanics and rules designed to facilitate epic stories and fun moments around the table. Some of those mechanics, like having a higher chance of success to pick a lock in combat, come with a significantly higher risk of failure. Failing to pick a lock outside of combat results in wasted time, repeated attempts, and generally just wasting your time until you either succeed, give up, or get past it in some other manner. Failing to pick a lock within combat often comes at the cost of assisting your allies in winning the combat. There are a number of moments when PCs might be expected to make Checks during combat in DC20 to aid in the victory conditions or ease the combat. Those actions are encouraged and facilitated by the "1 AP to grant yourself ADV" rule of combat.

    Keep in mind that casting Spells outside of Combat is already accounted for in that you reduce the cost of Spells outside of Combat (see below). The only time that this benefit is not felt is at levels 1 and 2, which I also feel is fine since we’re talking about “novice” spellcasters, so it makes sense to me that these lower-level spellcasters aren’t able to take advantage of this MP reduction (since they have to still spend a minimum of 1 MP).

> **DC Tip:** To those that find these explanations, both narrative and mechanical, unsatisfactory, I offer the following simple adjustment: any Check made during combat has its DC increased by 5. This is still the Beta and this concept of the game will continue to be monitored and polished, but I hope this empowers our GMs on how to run the game smoothly.

## Mana Points
Spellcasting PCs have Mana Points (MP) which can be spent on Spells, Spell Enhancements, Class Features, and Ancestry Traits.

**Gaining Maximum MP:** You can gain MP from the Spellcasting Mastery Feature granted by Spellcasting Classes (Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features.

**Regaining MP:** You regain all MP when you finish a Long Rest.

### MP Outside of Combat
When you spend MP outside of Combat, the cost is reduced by 1 (minimum of 1). The total MP cost before this reduction can’t be greater than your Mana Spend Limit.

> **DC Tip:** If you were to run 1 mile to a neighbor's house, there’s not much stress there… but if you were to run 1 mile away from a tiger that was chasing you… that’s FAR more difficult and exhausting. This concept holds true for Spellcasting too.

## Stamina Points
Martial PCs have Stamina Points (SP) which can be spent on Techniques, on Class Features, and in place of Action Points when performing Martial Maneuvers.

**Gaining Maximum SP:** You can gain SP from the Martial Mastery Feature granted by Martial Classes (Barbarian, Fighter, Rogue, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features.

**Regaining SP:** You can regain SP during Combat in a variety of ways depending on your Class Features. You regain all spent SP when Combat ends. 

> **Example:** The Fighter Class regains SP by performing Maneuvers, the Barbarian regains SP by taking or scoring Heavy, Brutal, and Critical Hits, and the Rogue regains SP by hitting a creature that’s affected by Conditions.

**Action Points to Stamina:** On your turn, you can spend 2 AP to regain 1 SP. 

**Mana to Stamina:** Once on each of your turns, you can spend 1 or more MP to regain 1 SP per MP spent.

### SP Outside of Combat
You can perform any Action outside of Combat that uses Stamina without spending any SP, however the SP cost can’t be higher than your SP maximum.

> **DC Tip:** Stamina Points should only be tracked when you’re in a high stress situation like Combat (or even some Skill Challenges). If time isn’t being tracked (such as during Skill Challenges) then there’s no need to keep track of SP. PCs can use and spend SP freely outside of these times and essentially be able to perform anything that uses SP at no cost, since they get the SP back instantly outside of Combat.

!!! note "Stamina & Mana Sidebar"

    This isn’t game breaking because Stamina Points are not like Mana Points. Features that use Stamina don’t provide magical benefits, they provide physical benefits such as being able to jump farther, shove things, or smash things. These things usually don’t provide many advantages outside of combat. It’s also intended that if a PC can spend SP to jump farther, then they should be able to use that outside of Combat to jump farther for free.

## Grit Points
Characters with a high Charisma Attribute have a strong force of will and ability to influence and impact others around them, especially their friends and allies. Grit Points represent a Characters being able to enact that ability on themselves or allies. 

### Grit Points
You gain a number of Grit Points equal to 2 + your Charisma. If your Charisma is negative, then your total Grit Points is reduced by the same amount.

**Regaining Grit Points:** You regain all expended Grit Points when you complete a Long Rest.

### Spending Grit Points
**Bearing Damage:** When you are Hit by an Attack, you can spend 1 Grit Point to reduce the damage you take by 1.

**Save Resolve:** When you or a creature that can see or hear you makes a Save, you can spend 1 Grit Point as a Reaction to grant the creature ADV on the Save. When you do, you must do so before the creature rolls any dice as part of making the Save. A creature can only gain the benefits of 1 Grit Point per Save.
