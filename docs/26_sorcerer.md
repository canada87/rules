## Sorcerer

Sorcerers tap into the raw magic in their own bodies as a conduit to harness, manipulate, and sculpt magic with wild resolve. They can overload themselves and even cast Spells without Mana, pushing the limits of magic and their own bodies.

**Source of Power:** A Sorcerer’s magic is in their blood, allowing them to tap into it naturally and use it in ways others can’t. This could come from a lineage of angels, dragons, demons, or something else. Some Sorcerer’s power could come from an incident that caused their body to be suffused with magic (such as a magical explosion, a blessing, or curse).
