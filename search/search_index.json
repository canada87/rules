However, when I run a Combat Encounter with a lot of monsters or lots of things going on, then I do use some of these methods to help me keep track of things.</p> <p>DC Tip: My biggest tip here is to limit how many REACTIONS you give your monsters. If a monster doesn't have any Reactions\u2026 then they\u2019re SUPER easy to run. As you get more practice you can start to add more and more Reactions to your monsters.</p>"},{"location":"29_gmtip/#tally-marks","title":"Tally Marks","text":"<p>This is my preferred method.

Once its turn comes, I\u2019d subtract the number of tally marks (2) from the AP of the Goblin (4) and would know he only has 2 left.</p> <p>Most of the time you don\u2019t have monsters taking a lot of Reactions, so you normally won't even have to use tally marks.</p>"},{"location":"29_gmtip/#use-dice","title":"Use Dice","text":"<p>I have used a d4 or a d6 and placed it behind my GM Screen next to the monster's name on the Initiative Order (where I write it down on a piece of paper).

PD generally protects against Attacks that deal Physical or Elemental damage, whereas MD protects against Mystical damage.</li> <li>Damage Reduction: Increasing a monster\u2019s Physical Damage Reduction (PDR) or Mystical Damage Reduction (MDR) further mitigates the amount of damage it takes when it does get Hit by an Attack, reducing the impact of an Attack on the monster\u2019s Health.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"29_monsters/#determining-defense-health-and-damage-reduction","title":"Determining Defense, Health, and Damage Reduction","text":"<p>To keep its survivability within reason, if you significantly raise the monster's Health, you should consider lowering its Defense proportionally. This adjustment ensures the monster doesn't become unkillable, maintaining a fair challenge for the PCs. Similarly, Damage Reduction, which reduces the impact of incoming attacks, should be balanced with Health and Defense to prevent creating an overly resilient monster. Thoughtful adjustments to these statistics help create encounters that are both challenging and enjoyable, avoiding frustration or monotony for the players.</p> <ul> <li>PC Attacks: Since the average damage of a level 1 PC is 2 damage per Attack (and they\u2019re likely to make 2 Attacks on their turn) you\u2019ll want to make sure your Monsters have enough Health, Defense, and Damage Reduction to survive 6 Attacks before being defeated (to ensure they last 3 rounds of Combat).</li> <li>Monster Defense: The PCs should have a 65% hit rate against the average monster, and since a level 1 PC has a +4 bonus to Hit, the average level 1 monster needs to have 12 Defense. This means about 4 out of 6 Attacks will hit a monster. Of the 4 Attacks that Hit, 2 are likely to be Heavy Hits (dealing +1 damage).</li> <li>Monster Health: If a PC scores 2 normal Hits and 2 Heavy Hits against a monster across 3 rounds of Combat, they would deal 10 damage. Accordingly, a level 1 monster should have 10 HP.</li> <li>Monster Damage Reduction: If you give a monster Damage Reduction (maximum of 1 at level 1), then you should decrease its HP. In the scenario above, a monster is hit by 4 Attacks across 3 rounds of Combat. If that monster had a 1 PDR, then they would take 4 less damage (1 less per Attack), so it would only need 6 HP instead.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"29_monsters/#monster-damage","title":"Monster Damage","text":"<p>The amount of health a PC has is a good indicator for determining how much damage a monster should deal if the goal is for the monster to potentially defeat the PC in no less than 3 rounds of Combat. To achieve this balance, the monster's average damage per round should be approximately one-third of the PC's total health. This ensures that the PC can withstand at least 3 rounds of attacks before being defeated, providing a fair yet challenging encounter that allows for strategic play and potential recovery or intervention from the PC's allies.</p> <p>DC Tip: The average health of a level 1 PC is 9 HP, so a Level 1 or 2 Monster should deal up to 3 damage per round. Anything more than a base damage of 3 could also end up \u201cone shotting\u201d a PC with 5 HP.</p>"},{"location":"29_monsters/#monster-action-points","title":"Monster Action Points","text":"<p>Spending Action Points (AP) can significantly increase a monster's damage output, thereby escalating the threat it poses to the PCs. By allocating AP towards powerful attacks or multiple strikes within a single turn, a monster can maximize its offensive capabilities, dealing substantially more damage than with standard Actions alone. This increase in damage potential can quickly turn the tide of battle, making encounters more perilous for the PCs. However, GMs must carefully balance this to avoid overwhelming the players, ensuring that the encounter remains challenging yet fair. Properly managing AP expenditure not only heightens the tension and excitement of combat but also tests the PCs' strategic responses and resource management, contributing to a more dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.</p> <p>Example 1: A monster\u2019s base Attack does 1 damage. With 4 AP, the monster can make 1 Attack that deals a total of 3 damage. Attack: 1 AP to Attack, plus 2 AP to increase the damage by 2 (total of 3 damage), plus 1 AP to gain ADV. If the Attack benefits from a Weapon Style (such as an Axe\u2019s +1 bonus against Bleeding creatures), then the damage increases to 4 total.</p> <p>Example 2: A monster\u2019s base Attack does 1 damage. With 4 AP, the monster can make 2 Attacks that deal a total of 3 damage. First Attack: 1 AP to Attack plus 1 AP to increase the damage by 1 (total of 2 damage). Second Attack: 1 AP to Attack (with DisADV) plus 1 AP to gain ADV (canceling out the DisADV to become a normal d20 roll).

Each party member describes what Skill Check they\u2019re about to do. The Bard of the group can\u2019t go up to each PC and take multiple Help Actions to grant multiple Help Dice to each of them. They can only do one\u2026 unless the Checks being made are separated in time enough, and the GM allows the multiple instances of Help if it makes sense. </p> <p>DC Tip: Basically Combat is more strict and structured in both turn order (Initiative) and in how much you can do at a time (4 Action Points per Round of Combat). If you\u2019re not in Combat, everything is more fluid and free form.</p> <p>Combat Actions Sidebar</p> <p>Combat in DC20 is a time when PCs are pushed to their absolute limit; a time when they rise to the occasion, often surprising themselves with what they\u2019re capable of doing. The way this is represented mechanically is by allowing players to spend AP in order to apply stacking ADV to significant rolls made during the most dire of situations. This perfectly reflects real life experiences of a \u201cmother's strength\u201d to rescue her child from a car or an athlete's propensity for performing best during the real event instead of in practice.</p> <p>There are many ways to justify why PCs are more capable and reliable within combat: adrenaline coursing through their system, pressure to succeed as failure isn't an option, or even excitement and other endorphins fueling their performance or putting them in a state of flow. Regardless of which of these you choose to substantiate this change in success rate, there\u2019s one more consideration to keep in mind.</p> <p>DC20 is a game with mechanics and rules designed to facilitate epic stories and fun moments around the table. Some of those mechanics, like having a higher chance of success to pick a lock in combat, come with a significantly higher risk of failure. Failing to pick a lock outside of combat results in wasted time, repeated attempts, and generally just wasting your time until you either succeed, give up, or get past it in some other manner. Failing to pick a lock within combat often comes at the cost of assisting your allies in winning the combat. There are a number of moments when PCs might be expected to make Checks during combat in DC20 to aid in the victory conditions or ease the combat. Those actions are encouraged and facilitated by the \"1 AP to grant yourself ADV\" rule of combat.</p> <p>Keep in mind that casting Spells outside of Combat is already accounted for in that you reduce the cost of Spells outside of Combat (see below). The only time that this benefit is not felt is at levels 1 and 2, which I also feel is fine since we\u2019re talking about \u201cnovice\u201d spellcasters, so it makes sense to me that these lower-level spellcasters aren\u2019t able to take advantage of this MP reduction (since they have to still spend a minimum of 1 MP).</p> <p>DC Tip: To those that find these explanations, both narrative and mechanical, unsatisfactory, I offer the following simple adjustment: any Check made during combat has its DC increased by 5. This is still the Beta and this concept of the game will continue to be monitored and polished, but I hope this empowers our GMs on how to run the game smoothly.</p>"},{"location":"8_combat/#mana-points","title":"Mana Points","text":"<p>Spellcasting PCs have Mana Points (MP) which can be spent on Spells, Spell Enhancements, Class Features, and Ancestry Traits.</p> <p>Gaining Maximum MP: You can gain MP from the Spellcasting Mastery Feature granted by Spellcasting Classes (Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard, etc.), from Talents (such as the Multiclassing Talents), or from Ancestry Features.</p> <p>Regaining MP: You regain all MP when you finish a Long Rest.</p>"},{"location":"8_combat/#mp-outside-of-combat","title":"MP Outside of Combat","text":"<p>When you spend MP outside of Combat, the cost is reduced by 1 (minimum of 1).

The Multiple Check Penalty from this turn applies to any Checks you make as part of this Reaction.</li> <li>State Trigger: The Trigger must be an observable event such as, \u201cI want to wait until an enemy moves into range to make an Attack against them,\u201d \u201cI want to wait until I see my ally get out of range before I shoot the barrel filled with explosives,\u201d or something else.</li> <li>Take Reaction: If the stated Trigger occurs at any time before the start of your next turn, then you can take the declared Action as a Reaction. If the Reaction requires you to spend any additional resources, such as Stamina Points or Mana Points, you spend them now. Your Reaction interrupts the events stated in the Trigger, allowing you to act before the events resolve.

You describe ice blasting out of your hands to try and intercept the fiery projectiles. You then spend 2 AP and choose to spend 3 MP for the Spell Duel. The enemy caster Makes their Spell Check in the same way that they would if you had done nothing. You also make your Spell Check and then both you and the enemy caster get a bonus to your roll equal to the MP spent. You compare your results together and see what happens as your magics collide midair.</p> <p>DC Tip: Get creative with your Spells and think of cool descriptions. See the examples below for increasingly creative ways to use your Spells\u2026 BUT it\u2019s always at the GM\u2019s discretion. Some of these examples might not be allowed by your GM. The examples below show different ways that the \u201crange requirement\u201d can be met, but as long as you are in range of either the caster, their targets, or a space between the two.</p> <p>Creative Example 1: An enemy casts a Lightning Bolt at an ally. You choose your Wall of Earth Spell and are in range of an area between the enemy and your ally. You describe rocks forming a wall between them and your ally attempting to block the lightning.</p> <p>Creative Example 2: An enemy casts Poison Cloud at an area. You choose your Gust Spell and are in range of at least one ally inside of the affected area. You describe a rush of wind shooting out from you to blow away the noxious cloud.</p> <p>Creative Example 3: An enemy casts Disintegrate at an ally. You choose your Dissonant Whispers Spell and are in range of the enemy caster. You describe entering their mind, giving them hallucinations that they\u2019ve already cast the spell.</p> <p>Creative Example 4: An enemy casts Fireball at an area. You choose your Calm Emotions Spell and are in range of the enemy caster. You describe attempting to change their emotions to be chill and relaxed so they won\u2019t want to hurt anyone anymore. Your GM says, \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d and you now have to pick some other Spell or the enemy\u2019s Spell goes off as intended. </p>"},{"location":"9_reaction/#wild-magic-table","title":"Wild Magic Table","text":"d20 Result 1 You turn into a small creature with the stats of a Sheep (HP 2, PD 5, Melee Attack +2, Damage 1). 2 You explode with a magical blast wave.
