# Actions & Reactions

## Actions

Anything that you spend Action Points on is considered an Action.

### Taking an Action

A creature can take an Action on its turn by spending Action Points (AP). The AP cost of taking an Action is listed in the Action’s description.

### Minor Action

Once per turn, you can perform up to 2 of the following actions without spending AP. You can't take additional Actions (such as the Attack Action) between these 2 actions.

* Open or Close a Door.
* Grab or Release an Item.
* Retrieve or Stow an Item.
* Draw or Sheathe a Weapon.
* Equip or Unequip a Shield. You can only perform this task once.

**Additional Minor Actions:** You can spend 1 AP to perform a Minor Action again during the same turn.

### Types of Actions

A creature can take the following Actions on its turn: Attack, Move, Disengage, Dodge, Grapple, Help, Hide, Object, Shove, and Spell Action.

## Offensive Actions

### Attack

You can spend 1 AP to make 1 Attack Check.

### Disarm

You can spend 1 AP to make an Attack Check Contested by the target's Athletics, Acrobatics, or Trickery Check (target’s choice). The target has ADV if they’re holding the object with 2 hands. You have DisADV if the target is larger than you. You can’t Disarm a creature that’s 2 Sizes larger than you. 

**Success:** The targeted object falls into an unoccupied space of your choice within 1 Space of the creature.

### Grapple

Using a free hand, you can spend 1 AP to attempt to Grapple another creature. Make an Athletics Check contested by the opposing creature’s Martial Check. You or the target may have ADV or DisADV on your Check based on each other’s size (see Moving & Grappling Creatures). 

**Success:** The creature is Grappled by you.

**Dragging:** You can move the target to any Space adjacent to you by spending your own Movement to do so. Alternatively, when you move, you can move the target with you, but you’re considered Slowed (Every 1 Space you move costs an extra 1 Space of movement).

**Ending a Grapple**

* **Escape Grapple:** The target can spend 1 AP to attempt to free itself from a Grapple. You must make an Athletics Check contested by the target’s Martial Check. **Failure:** The Grapple immediately ends.
* **Incapacitated Grappler:** If you become Incapacitated, the Grapple immediately ends.
* **Forced Movement:** If an effect attempts to forcibly move the target beyond your reach, you make the Check or Save instead of the target. If the effect targets both you and the target, you make 1 Check or Save for both of you. **Success:** The targets of the effect aren’t moved. **Failure:** The Grapple immediately ends, and the targets of the effect are moved.
* **Falling:** If the target begins falling (and you don’t), the Grapple ends if you can’t carry the target’s weight. If you can carry its weight, you hold it suspended in the air.

### Shove

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to push a creature within 1 Space of you. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target’s Martial Check. 

**Success:** You push the creature 1 Space away from you or to its left or right. 

**Success (each 5):** Push up to 1 additional Space.

**Knock Prone:** After the result, you can choose to reduce the total distance the target is pushed by 1 Space to knock them Prone instead.

### Tackle

If you move at least 2 Spaces in a straight line, you can spend 1 AP to attempt to Tackle a creature that’s your size or smaller. Make an Athletics Check contested by the target's Martial Check. 

**Success:** You Grapple the target and you both move 1 Space in the same direction you were moving then immediately fall Prone. 

**Success (each 5):** +1 Space moved.

## Defensive Actions

### Disengage

You can spend 1 AP to impose DisADV on Opportunity Attacks made against you until the start of your next turn.

**Full Disengage:** When you take the Disengage Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to become immune to Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.

### Dodge

You can spend 1 AP to impose DisADV on the next Attack or Grapple made against you before the start of your next turn.

**Full Dodge:** When you take the Dodge Action, you can spend an additional 1 AP to impose DisADV on all Attacks or Grapples made against you until the start of your next turn.

### Hide

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to Hide from 1 or more
creatures that can’t see you (Unseen). Make a Stealth
Check against any opposing creatures’ Passive Awareness.

**Success:** You become Hidden from creatures whose
Passive Awareness you beat (making you Unseen and
Unheard by them). You remain Hidden until you make a
noise louder than a whisper, make an Attack, cast a Spell
with a Verbal Component, or a creature takes the Search
Action and successfully locates you.

See “Hidden Creatures” on page 74 for more on hiding.

> **DC Tip:** When you take the Hide Action and beat an enemy’s
Passive Awareness, you only become Hidden from that
creature because it can’t see or hear you (you are both
Unseen and Unheard). However, if your Stealth Check beats
one enemy’s Awareness Score but not another’s, then you
are Hidden from the first enemy, but you’re not Hidden from
the second enemy.

## Utility Actions

### Move

You can spend 1 AP to move up to your Speed in Spaces (default of 5). You choose where to move, and can break up your movement by moving before and after taking a different Action. You can’t end your turn in a Space occupied by another creature.

> **Example:** A creature with 4 AP can take the Move Action to move 1 Space, take the Attack Action, move 1 Space again (2 total Spaces), take the Attack Action again, and then move 2 Spaces again (4 total Spaces). 

### Help

You can spend 1 AP to grant a creature a d8 Help Die that lasts until the start of your next turn. Upon granting the Help Die, you must declare which creature you’re Helping and the type of Check you’ll be aiding them with while meeting the following conditions:

* **Attack:** You declare 1 target for the Attack. You must be within 1 Space of the Attacker or the target of the Attack. While the Help Die lasts, it can be added to an Attack made against the target.
* **Skill or Trade Check:** You declare a type of Skill or Trade Check. You describe how you’re Helping them and must do so with a Skill or Trade that you have at least 1 Mastery Level in. You can use the same Skill or Trade or a different one.
 
The Help Die can only be used to aid the type of Check declared and disappears once it is used.

**Multiple Help Penalty:** Once you take the Help Action, each time you take the Help Action again before the end of your turn, your Help Die decays by 1 step, to a minimum of a d4 (d8 | d6 | d4). These Help Dice only decay when using the Help Action. Help Die granted by other sources (such as the Sword Maneuver) decay independently of any Help Dice grant through the Help Action.

> **Example:** A Barbarian is about to wrestle an alligator and will need to make an Athletics Checks. A Ranger with Mastery in the Animals Skill can grant the Barbarian a Help Die to add to their Athletics Check made to wrestle the alligator.

> **DC Tip:** When taking the Help Action, the GM may allow the PC to contribute to a Skill or Trade Check by using something other than their own Skill or Trade Mastery. If the PC is a Wizard, they may try to use a Spell to contribute to another creature’s Skill or Trade Check, but only if the GM decides that it makes sense to do so. 

### Object

You can spend 1 AP to perform 1 of the following object interactions:

* Drink a Potion or administer a Potion to another creature.
* Attempt to lock or unlock a Lock.
* Make a Trickery Check to activate or disable a trap or other mechanism.
* Transfer an item to or from another creature (only 1 of the two creatures spends 1 AP).
* Throw an item to a location you can see up to 5 Spaces away.

### Spell

You can spend 1 or more AP to cast a Spell that you know. If the Spell has a Mana Point requirement, you must spend that much MP to cast the Spell.
