## Creatures

### Creature Sizes

Creatures come in many different shapes and sizes ranging from a miniscule bug to a primordial titan and beyond. The number of Spaces a creature occupies determines its size for the purposes of rules that govern the interactions between creatures and their environment. The table below shows the 9 different creature sizes with examples for each and the number of Spaces they occupy.

| Size       | Examples                           | Spaces                                                                           |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Micro      | Spider See "Micro Creatures" below |                                                                                  |
| Tiny       | Cat                                | 1/4 Space (4 per Space)                                                          |
| Small      | Sheep                              | 1 Space                                                                          |
| Medium     | Human                              | 1 Space                                                                          |
| Large      | Horse                              | 4 Spaces: (2 x 2) or (4 x 1)                                                     |
| Huge       | Elephant                           | 9 Spaces: (3 x 3), (4 x 2), or (9 x 1)                                           |
| Gargantuan | T-Rex                              | 16 Spaces: (4 x 4), (5 x 3), (8 x 2), or (16 x 1)                                |
| Colossal   | Brontosaurus                       | 25 Spaces: (5 x 5), (6 x 4), (8 x 3), (12 x 2), or (25 x 1)                      |
| Titanic    | Blue Whale                         | 50 Spaces: (7 x 7), (8 x 6), (10 x 5), (12 x 4), (16 x 3), (25 x 2), or (50 x 1) |

**Micro Creatures:** Exceptionally small creatures, such as Ants, can share their Space with other creatures. They can end their turn in a Space occupied by other creatures (and vice versa).

### Moving & Grappling Creatures

Creatures of different sizes have bonuses or penalties when attempting to Grapple, push, move, and knock other creatures Prone by both mundane and magical means.

*   If you are 1 or more sizes larger than your target, you have ADV on such Checks and Saves.
*   If you are 1 size smaller than your target, you have DisADV on such Checks and Saves.
*   If you are 2 or more sizes smaller than your target, they’re immune to such Checks and Saves.

> **Example:** If a Medium sized Champion is trying to move a
Large sized creature, the Champion would have DisADV on
the Check they make to move it.

#### Grappled

You’re Immobilized.

#### Escape Grapple

You can spend 1 AP to attempt to free yourself from a
Grapple. Make a Martial Check contested by the Grappler’s
Athletics Check. **Success:** The Grapple immediately ends.

The Grapple also ends if any of the following occurs:
* **Incapacitated:** The Grappler becomes Incapacitated.
* **Falling:** The Grappler is unable to carry your weight
when you begin falling, provided they aren’t also falling
with you.
* **Forced Movement:** An effect forcibly moves you or the
Grappler, causing you to move outside the Grappler’s
reach. If the effect requires a Contested Check or Save,
the Grappler makes the Check or Save instead of you. If
the effect targets both you and the Grappler, the Grappler
makes 1 Check or Save for both of you. **Success:** The
targets are not moved. **Failure:** The targets are moved.

#### Grappled by Multiple Creatures
A creature that’s Grappled by more than 1 creature only
suffers the effects of being Grappled once. However,
a creature Grappled by multiple sources will remain
Grappled until they’re free from being Grappled by
all sources.

> **Example:** While Grappled, a creature is Immobilized
(DisADV on Agility Saves). A creature doesn’t have DisADV 2
on Agility Saves as a result of being Grappled by 2 creatures.
They only have DisADV on Agility Saves.

**Moving the Target:** If multiple creatures are Grappling the
same target and one of them tries to move the Grappled
target, it must make a Contested Athletics Check against
all creatures Grappling the same target. **Success:** It ends
the Grapple on the target by all creatures other than itself,
allowing it to move the creature as normal.

### Moving Through Creatures

While moving in Combat, there will be times when you’ll want or need to move through another creature’s Space. Whether the creature is friendly or hostile to you will determine whether or not you can freely move through their Space.

**Friendly Creatures:** You can move through a Space occupied by a friendly creature without having to spend any extra movement.

**Hostile Creatures:** You can move through the Space of hostile creatures that are 2 sizes larger or smaller than you, but you are considered to be Slowed while moving through the Space they occupy. If the creature is within 1 size of you, you can’t move through its Space unless you take the Pass Through Action (see "Pass Through" on page 45).

**Ending Your Movement:** You can’t end your turn in a Space that’s occupied by another creature.

### Collision

When a creature is thrown or knocked back and collides
with an immovable object (such as a wall) or another
creature, it takes damage upon impact.

* **Sudden Stop:** A creature stops in the Space where it made
contact with the object or creature.
* **Collision Damage:** A creature takes an amount of
Bludgeoning damage equal to the number of Spaces it
couldn’t travel (due to the collision).

> **Example:** A creature is knocked back 5 Spaces and impacts a
wall that’s only 2 Spaces away. The creature would be thrown
2 Spaces into the wall and then take 3 Bludgeoning damage
for the 3 Spaces they couldn’t be moved (5-2 = 3).

**Creature Collision:** If a thrown creature or falling creature
collides with another creature they both share the damage
(each take half). See “Shared Damage” on page 37 for
more information.

> **DC Tip:** In order to hit a target creature with a thrown
creature there’s usually an Attack Check, Athletics Check, or
Contest that needs to be made. Otherwise this would just be
“automatic” damage to the target creature.

### Falling Attacks

If you want to put more force into an Attack Check, you can
purposefully fall onto a target as part of your Attack Check.
To do this, you first need to move into a position to fall onto
the target. Using the Creature Collision rules from above,
you would count up the Spaces fallen and this number
will represent the falling damage that will be taken. You
can now make your Attack Check and resolve the damage
based on the result. Then (regardless of if you hit or miss)
you would share the damage taken from the fall. You would
take half of the damage and the other half would be added
to the damage they take as part of the same Attack Check.

> **Example:** If you jumped from 4 Spaces up, and your Attack
Check deals 3 damage, then the creature would take 5
damage (3 from Attack and 2 from fall) and you would take 2
damage (from the fall).

### Throwing

#### Throwing Creatures

You can spend 1 AP to throw a creature that’s Grappled
by you that’s the same size as you or smaller. Make an
Athletics Check Contested by the target’s Martial Check.
Success: You throw the creature up to a number of Spaces
away from you equal to 1/2 of your Might (ending the
Grappled Condition) + up to 1 additional Space for every
5 they fail the Contest by.

* **Smaller Size:** If the creature is a size smaller than you, the
distance thrown is equal to your Might (instead of half).
* **Vertical Toss:** You can choose throw the creature vertically
into the air. When you do, they distance thrown is halved
and it’s subjected to damage from Uncontrolled Falling (see
“Uncontrolled Falling” on page 67).
* **Team Throw:** If another creature has the same target
Grappled, that other creature can spend 1 AP as a reaction
to throw the target with you. You and the other creature each
make an Athletics Check and add your results together to
determine the total number of Spaces the target is thrown.
* **Throw at a Target:** If you throw a creature at a target,
you must make an Athletics Check and compare it to the
target’s PD. Hit: The thrown creature and the target share
the Collision damage (each take half). Miss: The thrown
creature continues traveling up to the distance thrown or
until it impacts an immovable object (such as a wall) and
takes full Collision damage.

> **DC Tip:** When 2 or more creatures share damage, divide
the total damage by the number of creatures (rounding up),
and distribute the damage equally among the creatures (see
Shared Damage for more information).

#### Throwing Objects

You can throw an object a number of Spaces depending
on your Might and the object’s size. For the purposes of
throwing objects, your minimum Might is 1. The table
below shows how far you can throw each size of object:

| Object Size            | Spaces Thrown  |
|:-----------------------|:---------------|
| 2+ Sizes smaller       | 5 x Might      |
| 1 Size smaller         | Might          |
| Same Size              | 1/2 Might      |
| Larger                 | Impossible     |

> **Example:** A Medium sized creature with a Might of 0 (minimum Might of 1) could throw a Tiny object up to 5 Spaces, a Small object 1 Space, and Medium object 1 Space (rounded up from 0.5). Conversely, if that creature had a Might of 6, they could throw a Tiny object 30 Spaces, a Small object 6 Spaces, and a Medium object 3 Spaces.

#### Throwing Melee Weapons

When you throw a Melee Weapon that lacks the Thrown
property as part of an Attack Check, the Weapon deals 1/2
its normal damage. The range of a Melee Weapon that lacks
the Thrown property is 1/5. See “Equipment” on page
75 for more information on Weapon properties.

> **DC Tip:** Basically ALL Weapons have a default range of 1/5 (unless otherwise stated). This means within 1 Space you can make an Attack Check with no penalties and deal full damage with the weapon, but between 2 and 5 Spaces away your Attack now has DisADV and the total damage that it deals is cut in half.

### Improvised Weapons

Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an Improvised Weapons
deals 1 damage of a type determined by the GM. When
making an Attack Check with an Improvised Weapon you
only add your Prime Modifier to your d20 roll, you don’t
add your Combat Mastery.

**Weapon Style:** Unless otherwise stated by the GM, an
Improvised Weapon doesn’t benefit from Weapon Styles or
Weapon Properties.

> **DC Tip:** If an Improvised Weapon is similar enough to an actual weapon, the GM might decide that it could gain certain Weapon Properties or even a Weapon Style.

### Unarmed Strikes

Unarmed Strikes deal 0 Bludgeoning damage. An
Unarmed Strike is a Melee Attack made using any part of a
creature’s own body, such as a Punch, Elbow, Kick, Knee,
or Headbutt.

> **DC Tip:** Attacks that deal 0 base damage can still benefit from bonus damage, such as Heavy Hits, Power Attack Maneuvers, Class Features, etc.

### Natural Weapons

A Natural Weapon is a part of a creature’s body that counts
as a Weapon (such as a Claws, Fangs, and Horns). When
you Attack with a Natural Weapon it’s considered both a
Weapon Attack and an Unarmed Strike.

**Wielding a Natural Weapon:** A Natural Weapon is
considered to be wielded by the appendage it’s attached to
unless that appendage is holding something.

> **Example:** A Beastborn with claws is considered to be
wielding the claws in their hands, qualifying these Natural
Weapons for Dual Wielding and similar mechanics.

### Non-Lethal Attacks

When you make a Melee Attack with a Weapon or
Unarmed Strike, you can declare the Attack to be Non-
Lethal. If a creature is reduced to 0 HP or lower by a Non-
Lethal Attack, they are knocked Unconscious instead and
are considered Stable for the purposes of Death’s Door.

If a creature is knocked Unconscious in this way, another
creature can spend 1 AP to shake them awake. When
the creature awakens, they are on Death’s Door at 0 HP,
regardless of how much damage was dealt by the Non-
Lethal Attack.

### Dual Wielding

You’re considered to be Dual Wielding when you’re
wielding a separate Weapon in each hand. When you make
an Attack with one of the Weapons you’re Dual Wielding,
your next Attack on this turn with the other Weapon
ignores the Multiple Check Penalty (and doesn’t advance
that penalty), provided you’re still Dual Wielding those
Weapons. You can only do this once on each of your turns.

> **DC Tip:** If one of your hands is a Natural Weapon (such
as a Claw or the Monk’s Iron Palm benefit), it counts as a
Weapon you are wielding in that hand for the purposes of
Dual Wielding.

### Flanking

You gain an additional +2 to your Melee Attack if the target
is Flanked. A creature is Flanked when it has 2 or more
enemies within 1 Space of it that are not adjacent to each
other, provided they aren’t Incapacitated or Prone. You’re
considered to be Flanking a creature if you are one of the
creatures causing it to be Flanked.

### Prone

While Prone, you’re subjected to the following effects:

* You have DisADV on Attacks, Ranged Attacks have
DisADV against you, and Melee Attacks against you
have ADV.
* **Crawl Speed:** Until you stand up, your only movement
option is to Crawl, which costs an extra 1 Space of
movement for every Space moved.
* **Ending Prone:** You can end being Prone by spending 2
Spaces of movement to stand up.

#### Prone in the Air

When you become Prone, you immediately enter an
Uncontrolled Fall unless you’re supported by a solid surface
(see the Falling section for more information).

### Hidden Creatures

Creatures that are Unseen or Unheard are more difficult to discover.

#### Unseen

You are Unseen by a creature while you’re imperceivable
to its visual senses, such as when you’re Fully Concealed,
you’re Invisible, or it’s Blinded. While Unseen, you’re
subjected to the following effects:

* You have ADV on Attacks against creatures that can’t see
you.
* Creatures that can’t see you have DisADV on Attacks
against you.

> **DC Tip:** If you are Unseen because you’re behind Full Cover,
effected by the Invisibility Spell, and your target is Blinded,
you don’t gain the benefits of being Unseen multiple times.
You are either Unseen or not.

#### Unheard

You are Unheard while you remain silent, talk no louder
than a whisper, or are within an area effected by the Silence
Spell or a similar effect. While Unheard, you’re subjected
to the following effects:

* You have ADV on Attacks against creatures you’re
Flanking that can’t hear you.

> **DC Tip:** If you’re Unheard because you’re remaining silent or
within an area effected by the Silence Spell, you don’t gain
the benefits of being Unheard multiple times. You’re either
Unheard or not.

#### Hidden

You are Hidden from a creature while you are both Unseen
and Unheard by it. Your location is unknown to creatures
you’re Hidden from.

> **DC Tip:** If you become Hidden to a creature that’s aware of
you, it only knows your last location known to it before you
became Hidden. Creatures that can detect your presence,
even through magical means such as divination, are not
considered to know your location, to see you, or to hear you
unless the Feature says otherwise.

### Underwater Combat

While underwater, creatures are subjected to the
following conditions:

* **Attack Penalties:** Martial Attacks are made with DisADV
using Weapons that aren’t Crossbows or Spears. Creatures
with a Swim Speed ignore this penalty. Additionally,
Ranged Attacks automatically miss targets beyond the
Weapon’s normal range.
* **Holding Breath:** Creatures that attempt to speak while
holding their breath underwater, such as to satisfy the
Verbal Component required to cast a Spell, reduce their
Breath Duration by 1 (see “Holding Your Breath” on page
68 for more information).
* **Fire Resistance:** Creatures and objects that are fully
immersed in water have Fire Resistance (Half) and are
immune to Burning.
