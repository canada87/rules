# 10 Step Character Creation Outline

During Player Character Creation you will get to customize
your PC in the following ways at Level 1:

* Choose Starting Attributes
* Choose Background (Skills, Trades, and Languages)
* Choose an Ancestry, and Class

## Player Character Creation

### Step 1: Attributes & Prime Modifier

You get your PC Attributes from one of the following
methods and then assign the values to each of the
4 Attributes.

**Standard Array**

You start with an array of 3, 1, 0, -2 and assign each value
to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain 2 additional
Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want,
up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**Point Buy**

You start with a -2 in all of your Attributes. You then gain
12 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you
want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

> DC Tip: Your Prime Modifier (see later in this chapter) comes from your highest Attribute, so it’s a good idea to make sure that you get a 3 in at least one of your Attributes. 

**Roll Method**

You determine your starting values by rolling 1d6-3 four
times, and then assign each value to an Attribute of your
choice. You then gain +2 Attribute Points to increase
whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

Prime Modifier Insurance: If the value of your highest
Attribute is less than 3 (even after adding the +2 Attribute
Points), you can reduce a different Attribute value by 1
or more to increase your highest Attribute by the same
amount. You can’t reduce an Attribute value below -2 or
increase an Attribute above your Attribute Limit (3).

> DC Tip: This method of determining your starting Attributes is the most risky. It offers the potential for the highest starting Attributes, but also the lowest. If you add all your Attributes together, their sum should be 2 (on average). If you get less than this, talk to your GM about potentially rerolling your Attributes (or using a different method).

**Prime Modifier**

Your Prime Modifier is equal to your PC’s highest Attribute.

> DC Tip: You really want your PC to have a 3 in one of their Attributes so they can have a 3 for their Prime Modifier at level 1. This is going to add to a lot of the things you do in Combat and is very important. 

### Step 2: Save Masteries

You add your Attribute bonus and your Combat Mastery
together. The result is your Save bonus for each Attribute.

> DC Tip: If you don’t have Mastery in the Save, then the value you write down will be equal to your Attribute. BUT in the 2 Saves that you chose to gain Mastery in, you add +1 to the Attribute, and that’s what you write down for the Save. 

### Step 3: Background (Skills, Trades, & Languages)

This represents how your were raised, what type of culture
you were around, and what you have done since birth. You
gain “Traits” from your Background at 1st level that grant
you some flavorful or mechanical benefits.

Each Background gives 5 Skill Points, 3 Trade Points, and
2 Language Points. You can’t go over the Mastery Limit of
Novice unless you have a Feature that allows you to do so.

> Beta Note: The only piece “missing” from Background is a “Background Trait”. This will be something 100% FLAVOR based and only enhance Roleplay. 

**Skills**

Your Background gives you 5 Skill Points, but you also
increase or decrease your Skill Points based on your
Intelligence Attribute.

**Starting Skill Points formula:**
```
Starting Skill Points = 5 + Intelligence (yes, you do subtract if your Intelligence is negative).
```

**Trades**

Your Background gives you 3 Trade Points. You can
convert 1 Skill Point into 2 Trade points, but not the
other way around.

**Languages**

Your Background gives you Fluency in the Common
Language and 2 Language Points that you can spend on any
Language of your choice. Additionally, you can convert 1
Trade Point into 2 Language Points.

**Background Starting Equipment**

Coming Soon. You get a list of starting equipment based on
your Background. You could instead choose to receive a flat
amount of gold or even roll for your gold.

### Step 4: Health Points

Fill in your Character’s HP. You may potentially add
more if you choose an Ancestry or Class that grants bonus
HP at Level 1.

**Starting HP Formula:**
```
Class HP + Might + Ancestry HP (if any)
```

> **Example:** A PC picks the Champion Class at Level 1 and
starts with a Might of 3 (the highest possible at Level 1). The
Champion Class grants a base of 9 HP. The PC then adds +3
HP from their Might to get a total of 12 HP (9 + 3). If any of
their Ancestry Traits increase or decrease their HP, they would
add those to the total to determine their starting HP.

### Step 5: Stamina & Mana Points

Fill in your Character’s SP and MP. Martial Characters
have 1 Stamina Point (SP), Spellcasters have 6 Mana
Points (MP), and Hybrid Characters (such as a Spellblade)
have 1 Stamina Point (SP) and 3 Mana Points (MP).

### Step 6: Defense

Fill in your Character’s Precision and Area Defense.

**Precision Defense**

```
PD = 8 + CM + Agility + Intelligence + Bonuses
```

**Area Defense**

```
AD = 8 + CM + Might + Charisma + Bonuses
```

**Damage Reduction**

Fill in each section’s Damage Reduction.

* **Physical Damage Reduction:** This only applies if you’re
wearing some types of Heavy Armor or Heavy Shields (or
have some other feature that grants PDR).

* **Elemental Damage Reduction:** This only applies if you’re
wearing some types of Heavy Armor or Heavy Shields (or
have some other feature that grants EDR).

* **Mystical Damage Reduction:** This most likely doesn’t apply
to your character (unless you have a feature that grants it).

### Step 7: Combat Modifiers

Fill out the rest of the blanks on your Character Sheet.

* Attack / Spell Check: +4
* Save DC: 14
* Martial Check: Highest between Athletics or Acrobatics
* Death Threshold: -4
* Move Speed: 5
* Jump Distance: Equals your Agility (minimum of 1)
* Rest Points: Equal to your HP maximum
* Grit Points: 2 + Charisma

### Step 8: Ancestry

Choose an Ancestry. This represents your biology and how
you’ve grown and developed since birth. You gain Ancestry
Traits from your chosen Ancestry at 1st, 4th, and 7th level.

> **DC Tip:** There are many different ways to create Ancestries
(both visually and mechanically). Make sure to collaborate
where needed with your GM.

**Ancestry Traits**

You choose 1 or 2 Ancestries to gain access to. You also get
5 Ancestry points that you can use to spend on Ancestry
Traits (see “Ancestry System” on page 104 for more).

> **DC Tip:** Some of these Traits might affect things you’ve
already added to your Character Sheet (such as HP,
Speed, etc.).

### Step 9: Class

Choose a Class. This represents how well trained you are
in martial combat, spellcasting, or both. You gain Class
Features at Level 1, 2, 5, and 8.

All Classes get to choose a Subclass at 3rd Level, then
gain additional Subclass Features at Level 6 and Level 9.
Keep this in mind when creating your character, so that the
flavor, backstory, and mechanics can blend well together
when you get to Level 3.

> Example: If you know you’re going to choose “Dragon Bloodline Sorcerer” then you should probably flavor some of your PC’s appearance or how they cast their spells with a draconic theme.

> DC Tip: If you don’t know what you’re going to select yet, that’s fine as well. I just recommend THINKING about it. 

**Class Features**

You gain a number of Class Features at Level 1 based on
which Class you chose (see “Classes” on page 117 for more)

* **Class HP:** All Classes have a Health Points column in their
Class Table. Martials get +1 bonus Max HP every Level
and Spellcasters don’t get any bonus HP. Rogues and
Spellblades get +1 bonus Max HP every other Level.

* **Cantrips, Spells, Maneuvers Known:** Check your Class
Table to see if you have any of these to pick.
 
* **Skill Points:** If your background already gave you one or
more of these Skills, you can replace those Skills from this
list with any Skill of your choice.

### Step 10: Weapons & Inventory

Choose what starting equipment you want. You gain some
from your Class and the rest from your Background.

> Beta Note: Currently the only thing this is right now is Weapons and Armor. Starting Equipment will be added in a future update. I personally let my PCs choose from a list of general adventuring supplies and we go from there. 

## Further Player Character Progression

Characters get stronger as they increase in Level. This chart shows what you get at each Level for all Classes.

> DC Tip: This table is a general representation of what the “standard” is for all classes, but make sure to check your Class specifically just in case.

## Leveling Up

When a Character levels up these are the updates you
need to make.

**Combat Mastery**

At levels 3, 5, 7, 9 (all “odd” levels) your Combat Mastery
increases by 1. The following things that Combat Mastery
and would also increase by 1.

* PD and AD
* Attack and Spell Checks
* Might, Agility, Charisma, and Intelligence Saves
* Save DC

**Attribute Points**

Check your Player Character Progression Table and see if
you gain any Attribute points.

* If you increase an Attribute, then you must also increase
each Skill that’s connected to that Attribute by the same
amount.
* Possibly increase your Prime Modifier if you just
increased your highest Attribute to be higher than it was
before.
* Update the Saves of any Attributes you increased.

**Skill, Trade, & Language Points**

Check your Player Character Progression Table and see if you gain any Skill Points or Trade Points.

* If you do, spend them to increase your Mastery Levels and increase those modifiers. 

> DC Tip: Remember not to exceed the “Mastery Limit” depending on what level you are. Level 5 is Adept, Level 10 is Expert, Level 15 is Master, and Level 20 is Grandmaster. 

**Health**

These are the categories that you could gain HP in:

* Check your Class Table for additional HP.
* If you increase your Might Attribute, then you also
increase your HP by 1 for each point of Might you gain.
* You could possibly gain an Ancestry Trait or other Talent
that grants an HP bonus..

**Defense**

**PD:** When you increase your Agility or Intelligence,
increase your PD by an equal amount.

**AD:** When you increase your Might or Charisma, increase
your AD by an equal amount.

[//]: # (## Additional Options)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### Max Level 10 + Prestige Levels)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The “max level” for each Class in DC20 RPG is Level 10, but there is a Prestige Path that unlocks at level 11. You can choose the Martial Path, Spellcaster Path, or Hybrid Path. These Prestige Paths grant additional bonuses, points, and Talents and will let you level up to level 20. This can be repeated again if the group wants to continue their story.)
