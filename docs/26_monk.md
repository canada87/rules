## Monk

Monks are master martial artists that perfect their mind
and bodies utilizing the ebb and flow of their inner energy.
They use their body as a weapon and can enter into different
stances that drastically change their combat abilities.

**Source of Power:** Monks have become enlightened and in
touch with their inner Ki energy to hone their bodies and
minds. Their journey to become a Monk could be from
being trained in a monastery, mentored by a mysterious
figure, or their own deep meditation.
