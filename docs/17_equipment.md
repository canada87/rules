## Equipment

### Weapons

All Weapons have a Type, Style, Requirements, Properties, and are either Magic or Mundane.

#### Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons: Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons.

##### Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons use your Melee Range (see "Melee Attack" on page 32).

> **DC Tip:** Any Melee Weapon can be used as an Improvised Weapon to make a Ranged Attack. These Attacks have a Range of 5 spaces, are made with DisADV, and deal only half damage on a Hit. 

##### Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see "Ranged Attack" on page 32).

> **DC Tip:** A Weapon with the Long-Ranged Property has a Range of 30/90. 

##### Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it, unless it has the Two-Handed Property (requires 2 hands to Attack).

#### Weapon Styles

While a PC with Weapon Mastery is wielding a Weapon, they can use that Weapon to benefit from its Weapon Style passive effect.

*   **Axe:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Bleeding.
*   **Bow:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Slowed.
*   **Chained:** Your Attacks ignore Shields and 1/2 Cover, and you deal +1 damage against targets that are wielding a Shield or are behind 1/2 Cover.
*   **Crossbow:** You deal +1 damage against the last creature you Attacked with the Weapon since the start of your last turn. Additionally, you don’t have DisADV on Attacks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
*   **Fist:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Grappled. Additionally, a Fist Weapon is considered to be a free hand when Grappling.
*   **Hammer:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Dazed or Petrified.
*   **Pick:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Impaired.
*   **Spear:** You deal +1 damage against a creature if you moved 2 Spaces towards it immediately before making the Attack or if it’s on a Mount. Additionally, you don’t have DisADV on Attack Checks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
*   **Staff:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Hindered.
*   **Sword:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Exposed.
*   **Whip:** You deal +1 damage with Melee Attacks against creatures that are farther than 1 Space from you.

> **Example:** A PC is wielding both an Axe and a Hammer. When they Hit a Bleeding creature with the Axe, they deal +1 damage against the target. They don’t deal this bonus damage when they Hit the Bleeding creature with the Hammer.

#### Weapon Properties

Weapons have certain properties that grant them different benefits or drawbacks.

*   **Ammo:** This Weapon requires ammunition to make Attacks. You can load a Weapon as part of an Attack made with it.
*   **Concealable:** You have ADV on the first Attack you make against a creature using a concealed Weapon. You can only gain this benefit against each creature once per Combat.
*   **Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
*   **Heavy:** The Weapon’s damage increases by 1.
*   **Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
*   **Long-Ranged:** Your Range increases to 30/90.
*   **Multi-Faceted:** The Weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you must choose which Weapon Style to use. The chosen Weapon Style determines the Attack’s damage type.
*   **Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
*   **Reload:** The Weapon’s damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon. 
    > **DC Tip:** If you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon using a Reaction, the Weapon must already be loaded to perform the Attack.
*   **Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you’re Hidden from. 
    > **DC Tip:** You must be both Unseen and Unheard to be Hidden. If you become seen while making the Attack, you’re no longer Hidden.
*   **Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10).
*   **Thrown:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20).
*   **Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it.
*   **Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the Weapon against targets within 1 Space of you. 
    > **DC Tip:**  The DisADV from Unwieldy stacks with the DisADV that Ranged Weapons get when used to make Attacks when an enemy is within 1 Space of you (making it DisADV 2).
*   **Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the Weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit using it.

##### Special Weapon Properties

*   **Returning:** When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.
*   **Capture:** When you Attack with this Weapon, you instead make a Martial Check contested by the target’s Physical Save. Success: The target is Grappled by the weapon until it’s freed. Forced movement doesn't end the Grapple, but teleportation does. Success (10): The target is also Restrained until it’s freed. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC 10 Might Check. Success: It can free itself or another creature within its reach. Dealing 1 Slashing damage to the Weapon (PD 10) ends the effect and breaks it, freeing the creature without harming it. A Weapon with this property deals 1 less damage. This Property has no effect on creatures that are formless, smaller than Small, or bigger than Large.

Damage Type Key: Bludgeoning (B), Piercing (P), Slashing (S)

> **DC Tip:** Attacks that deal 0 base damage can still benefit from bonus damage, such as Heavy Hits, Power Attack Maneuvers, Class Features, etc. 

#### Lacking Weapon Training

While wielding a Weapon you lack Training with, you do not benefit from its Weapon Style.

### Customized Weapons

You can create your own unique Weapons by following a 3 step process:

1.  Choose the Weapon Type.
2.  Choose the Weapon Style & Damage.
3.  Choose the Weapon Properties.

#### Step 1: Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons: Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons.

##### Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons use your Melee Range (see "Melee Attack" on page 32) and deal 1 damage.

##### Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see "Ranged Attack" on page 32) and deal 1 damage. Additionally, they automatically gain the following properties: Ammo, Two-Handed, and Unwieldy.

##### Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it, unless it has the Two-Handed Property (requires 2 hands to Attack).

#### Step 2: Weapon Style & Damage

Each Weapon Style has a particular Weapon Style benefit and damage type (in parenthesis) as shown below:

> **DC Tip:** You can only benefit from a Weapon’s Style if you have Weapon Mastery. 

##### Melee Weapon Styles

*   **Axe:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Bleeding.
*   **Chained:** (Bludgeoning) Your Attacks ignore Shields and 1/2 Cover, and you deal +1 damage against targets that are wielding a Shield or are behind 1/2 Cover.
*   **Fist:** (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Grappled. Additionally, a Fist Weapon is considered to be a free hand when Grappling.
*   **Hammer:** (Bludgeoning) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Dazed or Petrified.
*   **Pick:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Impaired.
*   **Spear:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against a creature if you moved 2 Spaces towards it immediately before making the Attack or if it’s on a Mount. Additionally, you don’t have DisADV on Attack Checks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
*   **Staff:** (Bludgeoning) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Hindered.
*   **Sword:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Exposed.
*   **Whip:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage with Melee Attacks against creatures that are farther than 1 Space from you.

##### Ranged Weapon Styles

*   **Bow:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Slowed.
*   **Crossbow:** (Piercing, Requires: Reload Property) You deal +1 damage against the last creature you Attacked with the Weapon since the start of your last turn. Additionally, you don’t have DisADV on Attacks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.

> **DC Tip:** At the GM’s discretion, you can use a Melee Weapon Style on a Ranged Weapon, and vice versa. GMs, be careful when allowing this for certain passives. For example, the Whip, Chained, and Spear Styles on a Ranged Weapon generate far more value than is expected and designed for within the system. You also might want to consider removing the “no longer having DisADV on Attacks made underwater” aspect of the weapon too it it wouldn’t make sense. 

##### Changing Damage Type

Each Weapon Style comes with a default damage type (shown above), but you can switch any of these default damage types to a different one (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing).

#### Step 3: Weapon Properties

When you pick a Melee or Ranged Weapon during Character Creation (or craft one later), you can grant it 2 additional Weapon Properties. You can’t grant a Weapon the same Property more than once.

> **DC Tip:** The Two-Handed and Unwieldy properties given to Ranged Weapons do not give you additional properties. 

##### Property Requirements

If a Weapon Property has a requirement, the Weapon must meet that requirement before you can add that Weapon Property to it.

##### Melee Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Melee Weapons.

*   **(1) Concealable:** You have ADV on the first Attack you make against a creature using a concealed Weapon. You can only gain this benefit against each creature once per Combat.
*   **(1) Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
*   **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property and Weapon Mastery) The Weapon’s damage increases by 1.
*   **(1) Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
*   **(1) Multi-Faceted:** The weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you must choose which Weapon Style to use. The chosen Weapon Style determines the type of damage dealt by the Attack.
*   **(1) Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
*   **(1) Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you’re Hidden from.
*   **(1) Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10).
*   **(1) Thrown:** (Requires: Toss Property) You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20).
*   **(-1) Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it. Can not be taken with the Versatile Property.
*   **(-1) Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the weapon against targets within 1 Space of you.
*   **(1) Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit with it. Can’t be taken with the Two-Handed Property.

##### Ranged Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Ranged Weapons. Additionally, you can spend 1 Property to remove the Two-Handed or Unwieldy Properties (or 2 Properties to remove both).

*   **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property and Weapon Mastery) The Weapon’s damage increases by 1.
*   **(1) Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
*   **(1) Long-Ranged:** Your Range increases to 30/90.
*   **(0) Reload:** The Weapon’s damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon. 
    > **DC Tip:** If you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon using a Reaction, the Weapon must already be loaded to perform the Attack.
*   **(1) Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you’re Hidden from.

##### Special Weapon Properties

*   **Returning:** (Requires: Toss Property) When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.
*   **Capture:** (Requires: Chained or Whip Style) The Weapon’s damage decreases by 1. When you Attack with this Weapon, you instead make a Martial Check contested by the target’s Physical Save. Success: The target is Grappled by the weapon until it’s freed. Forced movement doesn't end the Grapple, but teleportation does. Success (10): The target is also Restrained until it’s freed. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC 10 Might Check. Success: It can free itself or another creature within its reach. Dealing 1 Slashing damage to the Weapon (PD 10) ends the effect and breaks it, freeing the creature without harming it. A Weapon with this property deals 1 less damage. This Property has no effect on creatures that are formless, smaller than Small, or bigger than Large.

### Reskinning Weapons

Ultimately the Style and Properties of a Weapon you create are purely mechanical. With approval from your GM you can re-flavor the weapon to look like anything you want. You could make a Weapon that looks like a Sword but uses the Axe Weapon Style (so that you benefit from your target Bleeding instead of being Exposed).

> **DC Tip:** The visual look of a weapon is just flavor. All similar-looking weapons don’t have to function the exact same. Maybe your sword has a serrated edge and that’s why you chose the Axe Style. 

### Armor

You can improve your Physical Defense by wearing Armor. The Quality of Armor, the Type of Armor, and Armor Modifications influence whether your PD increases or decreases. You can create many different combinations of Armor using the variations of Armor Quality, Armor Type, and Armor Modifications.

#### Armor Quality

There are 3 types of Armor Quality: Novice, Adept, and Expert. Armor Quality refers to the Armor’s crafting and material quality. Higher quality Armor requires superior craftsmanship and materials, and has a higher gold cost. All types of Armors can be made with different levels of Armor Quality, and the quality of any set of Armor can be upgraded (Novice → Adept → Expert) by hiring a skilled craftsman with the necessary materials.

##### Armor Bonus

The higher an Armor’s Quality, the higher the Armor Bonus granted by the Armor, as shown in the table below.

| Armor Quality | PD Bonus |
| :----------- | :-------: |
| Novice       |    +1    |
| Adept        |    +2    |
| Expert       |    +3    |

#### Armor Types

There are 2 types of Armor: Light Armor and Heavy Armor. Creatures that aren’t wearing Armor are considered Unarmored.

##### Light Armor

Light Armor is a type of protection worn by most creatures to protect them from injury. Leather coats, padded jackets, and heavy robes are types of Light Armor.

*   **Light Armor Mastery:** All creatures have Light Armor Mastery.
*   **Non-Metal Armor:** Light Armor can be described to be made of many things but is not made of enough metal to be considered Metal Armor for the purpose of game mechanics (Features, Spells, Weapon effects, etc.) unless otherwise stated.

##### Heavy Armor

Heavy Armor is designed with greater attention in protecting the wearer in traditional warfare, requiring extensive combat training to use most effectively. Lamellar, laminar, and plate armor are types of Heavy Armor.

*   **Heavy Armor Properties:** Heavy Armor has a Might Requirement of 1 with the following properties:
    *   The Armor has 1 Physical Damage Reduction (PDR).
    *   While wearing the Armor, you have DisADV on Agility Checks.
*   **Heavy Armor Mastery:** You gain access to Heavy Armor Mastery through certain Class Features or Talents.
*   **Metal Armor:** All Heavy Armor is considered to be Metal Armor for the purpose of game mechanics (Features, Spells, Weapon effects, etc.) unless otherwise stated.
*   **Impactful Unarmed Strikes:** Your Unarmed Strikes gain the Impact Weapon Property (+1 damage on Heavy Hits) while wearing Heavy Armor. 
    > **DC Tip:** Punching with a metal gauntlet or headbutting while wearing a metal helmet gives your Unarmed Strikes a bit more “impact”.

#### Armor Table

| Quality      | PD Bonus | PDR | Agility Bonus | Agility Checks | Might Req. |
| :----------- | :-------: | :-: | :-----------: | :------------ | :--------- |
| Unarmored    |    +0    |  +0 |   Unlimited   |      -        |    None    |
| Light Armor (Novice) |    +1    |  +0 |   Unlimited   |      -        |    None    |
| Heavy Armor (Novice) |    +1    |  +1 |   Unlimited   |    DisADV     |     1      |

#### Agility Check Disadvantage

If an Armor or Shield says DisADV in the Agility Checks column, then you have DisADV on all Agility Checks while wearing or wielding it, such as Acrobatics, Stealth, and Trickery Checks.

#### Physical Damage Reduction (PDR)

Heavy Armor has Physical Damage Reduction (PDR), which reduces the damage of an Attack Check or Spell Check that targets a creature’s Physical Defense (PD). The amount reduced is equal to the DR value. A Heavy Hit (5 over PD), Brutal Hit (10 over PD), or Critical Hit (natural 20) bypasses PDR and deals full damage.

> **Example:** A creature makes an Attack Check to hit a target with a PD of 10. The result of their Attack Check is 12, which hits the target. The target has a PDR of 3, reducing the damage taken by 3. Alternatively, if the result of the Attack Check was 15, it would be 5 over the target’s PD of 10, making it a Heavy Hit. In this scenario, the PDR is bypassed and doesn’t reduce the damage. 

> **DC Tip:** Remember, when a creature takes damage, its Damage Reduction (DR) is applied before any Resistance or Vulnerability to damage. 

##### Attribute Requirements

If Armor has an Attribute requirement, then your corresponding Attribute must be equal to or higher than the listed value. If your Attribute is lower than the listed value, you are considered to lack Mastery with the Armor while wearing it.

#### Armor Modifications

Light Armor and Heavy Armor can be modified by a skilled craftsman to change its properties. Some merchants may sell Armor with some of these modifications included at the GM’s discretion. Below is a list of Armor Modifications available for Light and Heavy Armors. Each can only be taken once per set of Armor.

*   **Reinforced:** The Armor gains the following properties:
    *   The Amor’s PD increases by 1.
    *   The amount of Agility you add to your PD can’t exceed your Prime Modifier - 2.
*   **Sturdy (Light Only):** The Armor gains the following properties:
    *   The Armor’s PD increases by 1.
    *   While wearing the Armor, you have DisADV on Agility Checks.
*   **Dense (Heavy Only):** The Armor gains the following properties:
    *   The Armor’s Physical Damage Reduction (PDR) increases by 1.
    *   While wearing the Armor, your Speed decreases by 1.

#### Light Armor Modification Table

| Adjustment | PD Bonus | Max Agility Bonus | Agility Checks |
| :-------- | :-------: | :---------------: | :------------ |
| Reinforced |    +1    |   Prime minus 2  |      -        |
| Sturdy     |    +1    |         -         |    DisADV     |
| Both       |    +2    |   Prime minus 2  |    DisADV     |

#### Heavy Armor Modification Table

| Adjustment | PD Bonus | PDR | Max Agility Bonus | Speed     |
| :-------- | :-------: | :-: | :---------------: | :-------- |
| Reinforced |    +1    |  -  |   Prime minus 2  |    -      |
| Dense     |    -     |  +1 |         -         | -1 Speed |
| Both       |    +1    |  +1 |   Prime minus 2  | -1 Speed |

#### Max Agility Bonus

Normally a character adds their Agility to their PD. This applies a restriction on that. If you have a restriction of “Prime minus 2” that means that you are only allowed to add an amount of Agility up to a value that is equal to your Prime minus 2.

> **Example:** At Level 1 you have a Prime of 3, so this means that with this restriction, you would only be able to add up to 1 Agility to your PD (instead of 3 like usual). 

> **DC Tip:** If your character only has 1 Agility or lower, then you should ALWAYS take this Armor Modification, since your agility is already low. 

#### Starting Armor (Character Creation)

> **BETA NOTE:** When you first create your character you can choose either or both of the 2 modifications for the Armor you start the game with. This is the only time it is free and all future modifications will cost somewhere around 10g to apply and around 5g to remove. This will be elaborated on in future updates. 

#### Lacking Armor Training

While wearing Armor that you lack Training with, you have DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.

### Shields

All Shields have a Type, potential Requirements, potential Modifications, and are either Magic or Mundane.

#### Shield Type

There are 2 types of Shields: Light Shields and Heavy Shields. While wielding a shield, it occupies the hand that you’re holding it with.

##### Light Shields

Light Shields are simple and easy to wield. A buckler is a type of Light Shield. You gain access to Light Shield Mastery through certain Class Features or Talents.

##### Heavy Shields

Heavy Shields are designed for warfare, making them challenging to wield effectively without training. Round shields and kite shields are types of Heavy Shields. You gain access to Heavy Shield Mastery through certain Class Features or Talents.

#### Attribute Requirements

If a Shield has an Attribute requirement, then your corresponding Attribute Score must be equal to or higher than the listed value. If your Attribute is lower than the listed value, you are considered to lack Mastery with the Shield while wielding it.

#### Shield Table

| Type         | Shield Bonus | Property    | Might Req. | Agility Checks |
| :----------- | :----------: | :---------- | :--------- | :------------ |
| Light Shields |              |             |            |              |
| Buckler      |      +1      | -           |    -       |      -        |
| Heavy Shields |              |             |            |              |
| Round Shield  |      +2      | Toss (5/10) |     0      |      -        |
| Kite Shield   |      +2      | Mounted     |     1      |    DisADV     |

#### Shield Properties

These are listed off in the Shield Table and give additional properties when using the Shield in certain ways.

*   **Toss:** You can make a Ranged Martial Attack by throwing the Shield (5/10).
*   **Mounted:** The PD granted by the Shield also applies to your Mount.

#### Lacking Shield Mastery

While wielding a Shield that you lack Mastery in, you have DisADV on all Attack Checks and Spell Checks you make.

#### Attacking with Shields

You can make an Attack with a Shield you have Mastery with, dealing 1 Bludgeoning damage.

> **DC Tip:** If you have Mastery with Light Shields, you can use a Light Shield as a Weapon for the purposes of Dual Wielding (see “Dual Wielding” on page 72). 

### Adventuring Supplies

#### Gauntlet

You can purchase Gauntlets from a Blacksmith (or they come automatically with Heavy Armor). Wearing a Gauntlet gives your Unarmed Strikes with that hand the Impact Weapon Property (+1 damage on Heavy Hits).

> **Beta Note:** Prices are not set for things like Gauntlets, so a simple 5g should be a good price for now. 

#### Healing Potions

Healing Potions are crafted to magically heal wounds when consumed. These are (usually red) vials of liquid that are in small doses but potent in healing.

##### Healing Potion Levels

Healing Potions have levels to them that increase in potency and cost.

#### Healing Potion Level Table

| Level | Healing | Price  |
| :---- | :------ | :----- |
| X     | 2 x Level in HP | —     |
| 1st   | 2 HP    | 10g    |
| 2nd   | 4 HP    | 25g    |
| 3rd   | 6 HP    | 40g    |
| 4th   | 8 HP    | 60g    |
| 5th   | 10 HP   | 100g   |

#### First Aid Kit

A First Aid Kit is full of supplies and tools such as ointments, tinctures, bandages, and other medicinal reagents. A fully stocked kit contains 5 charges, which can be spent to treat a creature's wounds or cure an ailment by taking the Object Action.

*   **Treat Wounds:** You treat a Bloodied creature's wounds. Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. Success: Target creature regains 1 HP. Success (each 5): The creature regains +1 HP.
*   **Cure Ailment:** You treat a Disease or Poison (of your choice) afflicting the target. Make a Medicine Check against the DC of the Disease or Poison. Success: You neutralize 1 Disease or Poison afflicting the target. Success (each 5): The creature regains +1 HP.

##### Refilling a First Aid Kit

The reagents and bandages contained within the kit can be found in most towns and climates. Enough supplies for 1 charge can be bought for 5g at a general store or found using a Rest Action scavenged from an appropriate climate (GM's discretion) with a DC 15 Survival Check. Success: The kit regains 1 charge. Success (each 5): The kit regains +1 additional charge.

> **Beta Note:** Rest Actions will be expanded on in future updates. Basically you can do this as part of a Long Rest (8 hours).
