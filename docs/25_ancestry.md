# Ancestry System

During character creation you must choose your character’s
Ancestry, which represents the physical form your
character takes in the world, such as Human, Elf, Dwarf,
Halfling and Gnome. Each Ancestry has a list of Ancestry
Traits, which you can gain by spending Ancestry Points.

## Ancestry Traits

Ancestry Traits give your character physiological properties
or abilities based on your Ancestry. You can choose various
combinations of Ancestry Traits to customize your character
to express the type of fantasy race you want to play.

### Ancestry Points

Ancestry Points can be spent to gain Ancestry Traits.
Most Traits cost between 1 and 3 Points, however, some
Traits have a Point value of 0 or lower: Minor Traits and
Negative Traits.

#### Gaining Ancestry Points

When first creating your character, you have 5 Ancestry
Points. You gain 2 additional Ancestry Points when you
reach Level 4, and again when you reach Level 7.

### Types of Ancestry Traits

Each Ancestry has 4 kinds of Ancestry Traits.

#### Minor Ancestry Traits

These Traits cost 0 Ancestry Points and provide minor
benefits that are respective of each Ancestry’s unique
abilities and origins. You can only choose 1 Minor Trait.

#### Negative Ancestry Traits

These are Traits that have a negative Point value due to a
penalty it gives your Character. These give you additional
Ancestry Points equal to the negative value of the Trait.

> **Example:** If you choose the Negative Trait Reckless (-1), then you would gain the Trait (which reduces your PD by 1) and also gain 1 Ancestry Point (since the value of the Trait is worth -1). This now would technically give you 6 total Ancestry Points to spend now, but you will still end with a total of 5 (6 -1). 

#### Default Ancestry Traits

These are a set of pre-defined Ancestry Traits that are
worth a total 5 Ancestry Points. These include a Minor
Trait and may also include a Negative Trait.

> **DC Tip:** This is perfect for new players! They can just say, “I
want to be an Elf,” and get the pre-made list of the Elf Default
Traits and be done with this step of Character Creation.

#### Expanded Ancestry Traits

These are optional Ancestry Traits that you can choose
from to customize your Character’s Ancestry for either
mechanical or flavor reasons.

> **DC Tip:** Some groups or GMs might choose to ignore these Expanded Ancestry Traits to speed up character creation (for new groups or for one shots) or if they want to have a “consistent” feel for all Ancestries.

## Ancestry Origins

!!! note "Ancestry Flavor vs Mechanics"

    Player Characters are unique in this aspect,
    and with so many options you’re able to
    create a wide variety of Ancestry Origins.
    You can customize them and make them
    your own, either for mechanical reasons or
    flavor/lore reasons.

#### Ancestry Flavor

This is where you can say what your Character looks like
based on their Ancestry. Maybe you choose Dwarf and
Elf for your 2 Ancestries. Now you get to decide how
they look, which has nothing to do with game mechanics.
Maybe you’re a tall slender elf with a huge beard, maybe
you’re a thick stocky dwarf with smooth hairless skin and
pointy ears, or maybe you look completely like a Dwarf
and all of those “Elven Traits” are more recessive and aren’t
represented visually. You might have the EYES of an elf,
but everything else looks Dwarvish.

> **DC Tip:** Maybe you love the Mechanics of a Gnome, but you
really want to play a Halfling. Talk to your GM about if it’s ok
to completely separate the mechanics of your character from
what you visually look like. Work together and brainstorm
how your Halfling Character gained the mechanics of a
Gnome (through magic, through practice, or etc.).

If you wanted to play a Dwarf that had a backstory of being
from a long line of Dwarves, you totally can! Pick Dwarf
and then ask yourself, “How else do I want to express my
Character?” If you’re going to be a Cleric, then maybe
look into the Angelborn Traits. If you want to play a brave
Dwarf, then maybe look into the Halfling (they have a
Halfling Bravery Trait). This doesn’t mean that you are
that Ancestry, or that one of your parents were, it’s just a
way to further express your character and let them have the
Traits that best fit them.

> **DC Tip:** If your ideal Dwarf possess Traits only included in the
Giantborn Ancestry list, pick some of those Traits for your
“Dwarf” so you can create the character you have in mind.
You can describe your Mixed Ancestry character as being a
specific kind of Dwarf or a Dwarf/Giantborn hybrid. You can
express your Ancestry however you wish.

#### Ancestry Mechanics

This is where you choose your Ancestries based on the
game mechanics of what Ancestry Traits they offer. Build
out your character accordingly and then step back and see
what your character would look like. I had a player make
a character that just wanted to make a BIG Barbarian, so
he chose Giantborn and Orc. I asked him what that looks
like, and we talked about it and decided that he was going
to be an “Ogre-born” which ended up being a really cool
enhancement to his backstory... even though his choices
were based on game mechanics.

### Ancestry Appearance

The appearance of this new Ancestry is for the PC and
GM to come up with together (also making sure it fits into
the lore of the setting). The Ancestry could look similar
to an already existing Ancestry but be magically different
for other reasons. The Ancestry could be an entirely new
species that you want to bring into the world, mixing
and matching Traits around to get the exact right feel
for your PC.

> **DC Tip:** How I have always handled this is that the visual
aspect of a character is completely up to the player, then the
Ancestry Points take care of the “balance” and the mechanics
of what that Ancestry can do.

### Ancestry Lore & Flavor

Each Ancestry has unique biological and cultural pieces that
can combine with Backgrounds to create very unique PCs.

* Unique Biology Facts
* Ancestry Quirks Table
* Names List
* Ancestries’ Cultures

This will be available at the release of the full game. The
Beta is focused on the mechanics of the game, so the flavor
and lore will be revealed in the future.

## Ancestry Creation

Every character starts with the Base Ancestry Traits below,
and their Ancestry gives them a list of additional Traits they
can spend their 5 Ancestry Points on.

### Base Ancestry Traits

*   **Size:** Your Size is Medium.
*   **Speed:** You have a Speed of 5 Spaces.
*   **Creature Type:** Your Creature Type is Humanoid.

### Choose Your Ancestry

Pick 1 or 2 Ancestries to show where your character
comes from, what they look like, or how they perform
mechanically. This usually represents what Ancestry your
character’s parents were. When you select an Ancestry,
you gain access to its Ancestry Traits List (Default
and Expanded).

#### Starting with 1 Ancestry

You gain access to its Ancestry List. You can choose a second
Ancestry any time you gain additional Ancestry Points.

> **DC Tip:** This does give you less options during Character
Creation, but gives you more flexibility to choose a second
Ancestry at a later time as the direction you take your
character evolves.

#### Starting with 2 Ancestries

You gain access to both Ancestry Lists of each
chosen Ancestry.

> **DC Tip:** This gives you more options during character
creation, but somewhat less flexibility at higher levels when
you gain additional Ancestry Points.

### Spend Your Ancestry Points

You have 5 Ancestry Points to spend on any Ancestry Traits
from among your Ancestry Trait Lists. Your Ancestry
needs to have a total of 5 Ancestry Points worth of Traits
(including negative Traits). You can choose multiple
Negative Traits, but you can only choose 1 Minor Trait.
You must spend all your Ancestry points during character
creation (you can’t save them for later).

#### Gaining & Losing Negative Traits

You can’t gain more than 2 Ancestry Points total from
your Negative Ancestry Traits. You can remove Negative
Ancestry Traits at higher Levels by spending 1 Ancestry
Point if their cost is (-1) or 2 Ancestry Points if their
cost is (-2).

#### Duplicate Ancestry Traits

You can’t choose a Trait of the same name multiple times,
unless it says otherwise.

> **Example:** A PC chooses Dwarf and Giantborn as their 2 Ancestries. The Tough Ancestry Trait is available to both Ancestries. The PC could only choose the Tough Ancestry Trait once, even though it’s available to both Ancestries.

#### Ancestry Trait Requirements

If an Ancestry Trait has a requirement, such as a Level
requirement, then you must meet that requirement to
choose that Ancestry Trait.

#### Attribute & Mastery Increases

Certain Ancestry Traits grant increases to Attributes,
Skills, and Trades. These Ancestry Traits can’t exceed the
Attribute Limit, Skill Mastery Limit, or Trade Mastery
Limit, unless they say otherwise.

### Refunding Ancestry Traits

If you gain a Talent or Feature that grants you a benefit that’s
identical to (or a better version of) an Ancestry Trait you
have, you can choose to immediately replace that Ancestry
Trait with 1 or more other Ancestry Traits available to you
that are worth the same amount of Ancestry Points.

> **Example 1:** A Dwarf with the Natural Combatant Ancestry
Trait (grants Mastery with Heavy Armor and all Shields) uses
their 2nd Level Talent to pick the Martial Expansion Talent
(grants Mastery with all Weapons, Armors, and Shields),
then the Dwarf would be refunded the Ancestry Points
they spent to gain Natural Combatant and would need to
immediately use those Points to gain a different Ancestry
Trait available to them.

> **Example 2:** If you have an Ancestry Trait that grants you
Water Breathing and Swim Speed, then later you gain a Class
Feature that ONLY grants a Swim Speed (but not Water
Breathing), that would NOT count and you wouldn’t get any
Ancestry Points refunded to you (you would keep both). If you
later get another feature that ONLY grants Water Breathing,
you could then get a refund for the Ancestry Trait since you
would have other Features or Talents granting you the exact
same (or better) abilities.

> **DC Tip:** There might be a scenario where a Minor Trait is
replaced by a Feature or Talent. In this case a GM could allow
a Player to pick another Minor Trait from another Ancestry (if
it would make sense for that PC).

## Variant Rules

### Custom Ancestries

If you want to give your PC a personalized Ancestry or you
want to combine 3 or more Ancestries together, you can
create a Custom Ancestry. This gives Characters access to
ALL Ancestry Lists at once but only gets 4 points to spend
instead of 5. All other Ancestry Creation Rules still apply.
When you gain Ancestry Points, you can spend them on
any Ancestry List of your choice.

> **DC Tip:** This would be a Variant Rule within a Variant Rule. You could choose to have PCs get the full 5 Ancestry Points for creating their Custom Ancestry, but keep in mind this would be VERY strong and the default option for most everyone at the table (for both min maxing and RP reasons). If you are ok with this, then let them have the full 5 Points instead of 4.

### Variable Negativity

This Variant Rule allows you to gain Negative Ancestry
Traits when you gain Ancestry Points after Character
Creation. You still can’t gain more than 2 Ancestry Points
total from your Negative Ancestry Traits at a time.

### Stronger or Weaker Ancestries

Game Masters can choose to start the game off with higher
or lower Ancestry Point totals (instead of 5).

* **Lower Points:** If you want less power to come from Ancestries, and want it to be more of a subtle thing they get, you can lower the Ancestry Point total down to 4, 3, or 2. The player would have to choose which Ancestry Traits they get to use to equal that total for that character. 
* **Higher Points:** If you want to give your players more power and customization at the start of the game, you can give them more Ancestry Points to build a stronger Ancestry with.

> **DC Tip:** I would be very careful with this. The game is
balanced around PCs getting 5 points, so there could be some
very powerful combinations players could take advantage of.

### Ancestry Adoption

This option allows you to select one Ancestry Trait from any Ancestry available, then follow the rules as written for spending the rest of your Ancestry Points.

> **DC Tip:** You could be making this choice for tactical combat reasons, roleplay reasons or anything in between. Talk to your GM (and even the rest of your party) to show what unique twist you have added to your PC.

### Ancestry “Magic Items”

This option allows you to “think outside the box” on why
your PC can do what they can do and where they got their
“powers” from. With this rule, you can choose from any of
the Ancestry Traits and give yourself a “magic item” that
represents that power. You can do this multiple times for
multiple points worth of traits. You can tie all these points
into a single item or into multiple items.

> **Example:** You want to play a “normal” Human PC, but you REALLY want to have a Breath Weapon (from the Dragonborn Ancestry) and you DON’T want to say that you are “part Dragonborn”. You can create a Human with 3 points spent in the Human Ancestry and with the other 2 points, you can get the Dragonborn’s Breath Weapon, but you could describe that it comes from a “magic ring” on your finger. This allows you to play the fantasy of a human, while still having the “magical abilities” that you want.

> **DC Tip:** I have done this myself with Class Features before. I had a PC who was a complete commoner… but he happen to find a magic sword and as soon as he picked it up he was granted the powers of a Spellblade. If I ever lost the sword, then those powers were gone. Its a very unique way to make a unique PC.

#### GM and PC Notes

Keep in mind that this “feature” is now being represented
by an object that’s not part of the PC. This means that it
could be stolen or possibly work differently if the PCs go to
an area that nullifies the effects of magic items (making the
item stop working). So have an open dialogue with each
other about this and how it might look at your table.

### Angelborn

#### Fallen Angelborn

backstory, or this can happen mid-campaign after a large
change in your character.

You gain the following Ancestry Trait:

* **(0) Fallen:** You can now spend your Ancestry Points on
Fiendborn Traits.

> **DC Tip:** You aren’t considered to be a Fiendborn, you just
gain access to its Traits. You can only have one “0 Point”
Ancestry Trait when creating your character, so if you
want to start the game with this feature you can’t also take
Divine Glow.

**Default Traits**

Radiant damage.

  Fall 4 Spaces.
