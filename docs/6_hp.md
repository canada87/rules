# Health Points & Death’s Door

## Health Points

Health Points (HP) are a game statistic representing a creature’s ability to sustain damage. The stronger the creature, the more HP it generally has, signifying the greater difficulty in defeating it.

> **Example:** A Commoner has 4 HP, a Mastiff has 3 HP, a Cat has 2 HP and a Rat has 1 HP.

> **DC Tip:** Most damage a creature takes is nonlethal and just “wears them down” until they get closer and closer to Death’s Door. Lighter hits might graze you, while bigger hits knock you off your feet. The description and roleplay of how damage is taken can change depending on its source and the situation, but Health Points represent how much of a beating you can take before you die.

### Health Points at 1st Level

A PC has a number of Health Points equal to 6 + Character Level + Might. A PC also might gain additional HP from its Ancestry or Class.

**Health Point Formula:**

```
6 + Level + Might + (Possible Class or Ancestry Bonus HP)
```

**Example 1:** A PC starts with a base of 6 HP. It then adds its Characters Level, which is 1 HP at level 1. Using Standard Array to get your Attributes, the highest starting Might you can have is +3. Before considering any bonuses granted by Ancestry Traits or Class Features the highest starting HP a PC can have is 10 HP (6 + 1 + 3) and the lowest is 5 HP (6 + 1 - 2).

**Example 2:** Certain Ancestries and Classes grant additional HP. For example, the Giantborn Ancestry grants an extra +1 HP, and the Fighter Class grants an extra +1 HP at level 1, for a total HP of 12 HP (10 + 1 + 1).

> **DC Tip:** Make sure you check each of these categories as you level to keep your maximum HP updated. You basically get 1 HP each time you level up + 1 more for each Attribute point you gain in Might. You also might get additional HP from Talents and Features you choose.

### Temporary Health Points

Temporary Health Points (Temp HP) are additional Health Points that persist for a limited duration. When you take damage, your Temp HP is reduced first, and then any remaining damage carries over to reduce your HP.

*   **Stacking:** Temp HP doesn’t stack. If you gain Temp HP from different effects, you choose which effect to gain Temp HP from, and ignore the Temp HP granted by the other effects.
*   **Duration:** Temp HP lasts until you complete a Long Rest, or its reduced to 0 by taking damage. An effect that grants Temp HP may state a shorter duration, such as 1 minute, until you complete a Quick Rest, or a Short Rest. When the duration expires, all Temp HP gained immediately vanish. 

### Health Thresholds

Certain game mechanics affect creatures while their current HP is within certain thresholds.

*   **Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/2 its HP maximum.
*   **Well-Bloodied:** HP is equal to or lower than 1/4 its HP maximum.
*   **Death’s Door:** HP is equal to or lower than 0 HP, to a minimum of its Death Threshold

A creature’s Death Threshold is equal to 0 HP minus its Prime Modifier.

> **DC Tip:** If a creature is on Death’s Door, it’s still considered to be Bloodied and Well-Bloodied, because their HP is still below 1/2 their maximum (Bloodied) and 1/4 their maximum (Well-Bloodied).

> **Example:** A creature with a maximum HP of 8 is considered Bloodied when its HP is 4 or lower, Well-Bloodied when its HP is 2 or lower, and on Death’s Door when its HP is 0 or lower. If its Prime Modifier is 3, the creature’s Death Threshold is -3 HP. That creature dies if its HP is ever reduced to -3 HP or lower.

## Death’s Door

When you are reduced to 0 HP or lower, you suffers the following effects:

*   **Exhaustion:** You immediately gain Exhaustion 1.
*   **Action Point Limit:** You can’t spend more than 1 AP until the end of your next turn, until you’re restored to 1 HP or higher.
*   **Concentration:** You can’t Concentrate.
*   **Death Save:** At the end of each of your turns, you make a Death Save. 
    *   **Failure:** You take 1 True damage. 
    *   **Critical Failure:** You fall Unconscious until you’re restored to 1 HP or higher. 
    *   **Critical Success:** You’re restored to 1 HP.

> **DC Tip:** DC Tip: You basically can only spend 1 AP per round of Combat, either on your turn or as a Reaction. This only lasts while you’re on Death’s Door.

### Making Death Saves

When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20. If the result is 10 or higher, it succeeds on its Save. A creature makes Death Saves until it’s restored to 1 HP or higher, becomes Stabilized, or dies.

### Stabilized

A creature that takes the Medicine Action (see the Skill Based Actions section) and succeeds on a DC 10 Medicine Check can Stabilize a creature on Death’s Door.

A Stabilized creature doesn’t make Death Saves while on Death’s Door. A creature remains Stabilized until it’s restored to 1 HP or takes damage.

### Continuous Damage

Continuous damage (such as Bleeding and Burning) does not affect your HP while on Death’s Door. You still have these conditions on you, but they don’t deal damage to you unless you’re above 0 HP.

### Death’s Door After Combat

When Combat ends, any creature on Death’s Door must immediately make a Death Save. They repeat this Death Save every 12 seconds until they become Stabilized, are restored to 1 HP or higher, or die.

*   **Failure:** The creature takes 1 True damage and falls Unconscious until it becomes Stabilized. 
*   **Success:** The creature becomes Stabilized.

### NPC’s on Death’s Door

Monsters and NPCs normally die when they’re reduced to 0 HP, however the Game Master can choose to implement Death’s Door on special enemies. They would drop down to 1 AP and be on Death’s Door in that same weakened state, leaving a window for them to still talk to the party and get out any “last words” before someone puts them out of their misery.

!!! note "Death’s Door Sidebar"

    When a PC is reduced to 0 HP, they’re on “Death’s Door” and fighting for their life. This is represented however the player wants to describe this state looking for them. They are NOT unconscious, they’re in a heavily weakened state… about to die if something isn’t done SOON! They could be prone, crawling on the ground, holding themselves up with their sword, or spitting out blood as they hold on for dear life.

    If your Death's Door Threshold is -3 HP and you take a large enough hit that reduces you to -3 or lower… you’re instantly dead. If you have 1 HP and take 4 damage… you die. This means that PCs should avoid getting to low HP while against fearsome enemies at all costs. They should use healing magic, Class Features, spend AP defensively, or use consumables to avoid being at low HP… like they SHOULD be doing anyway!
