## Attributes & Prime Modifier

### Attributes

There are 4 Attributes in DC20 that represent your Physical
(Might & Agility) and Mental (Intelligence & Charisma)
abilities. Each Attribute has a value that ranges from -2 to
+7 (for most creatures) which measures your aptitude with
that Attribute.

* **Might** = your Strength of Body.
* **Agility** = your Balance, Nimbleness, and Dexterity.
* **Charisma** = your Charm, Presence, Persuasiveness, and
Force of Will.
* **Intelligence** = your Reasoning, Understanding, and
Wisdom.

> **Example:** If you have an Agility of 3, then you would add +3
to any d20 roll that uses Agility

#### Might

This represents your physical strength, health, and
endurance. It’s commonly associated with the following:

* Your Might is added to your Area Defense.
* Your Might is added to your maximum Health Points.
* Checks made to Initiate or Escape Grapples use Athletics
(Might) Checks.
* Might contributes to lifting, pushing, dragging, throwing,
and encumbrance.
* Might Saves are made to resist effects that push you
away, knock you down, or crush you.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that’s the “go to” for being the strong one and overpowering your enemies, then Might is for YOU!

#### Agility

This represents your avoidance, dexterity, and finesse. It’s
commonly associated with the following:

* Your Agility is added to your Precision Defense.
* Agility contributes to your Initiative Check.
* Checks made to Escape Grapples use Acrobatics (Agility)
Checks.
* Agility contributes to jumping and reducing damage
taken from falling.
* Agility Saves are made to resist effects that reduce your
Speed, cause you to lose your balance, or can be avoided
by dodging out of the way.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay a PC that’s nimble, light on their feet, and good with their hands, then Agility is for YOU!

#### Charisma

This represents your charm, presence, and force of will.
Anything related to interacting socially with other creatures
(your appearance, mannerisms, and the words you say) is
Charisma. It’s commonly associated with the following:

* Your Charisma is added to your Area Defense.
* Charisma can contribute to Language Checks made to
understand languages you have limited fluency with.
* You gain a number of Grit Points equal to your Charisma
+ 2. See “Grit Points: 2 + Charisma” on page 93.
* Social Skill Checks use Charisma, such as the Skills to
Influence other creatures or to gain Insights into their
actions or behaviors.
* Charisma Saves are made to resist effects that attempt to
alter your emotions or dominate your will.

**DC Tip:** If you want to Roleplay as the “face of the party” and have good people skills, then Charisma is for YOU!

#### Intelligence

This represents your reasoning, understanding, and
wisdom. Anything that is related to a person’s intellectual
capacity or overall knowledge falls under Intelligence. It’s
commonly associated with the following:

* Your Intelligence is added to your Precision Defense.
* Intelligence can contribute to Language Checks made to
understand languages you have limited fluency with.
* You gain a number of bonus Skill Points to spend on more
Skills.
* Knowledge Trade Checks use Intelligence, such as the
knowledge of Engineering, Nature, Religion, Occultism,
History, or Magic (Arcana).
* Intelligence Saves are made to resist effects that attempt
to read your thoughts, alter your memories, confuse you,
or use illusions to deceive your senses.

**DC Tip:** If you want to roleplay a PC that’s the smartest person in the room and just *knows things*, then Intelligence is for YOU!

### Starting Attributes

You get your PC’s Attributes from one of the following methods and then assign the values to each of the 4 Attributes.

#### Standard Array

You start with an array of 3, 1, 0, -2 and assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain 2 additional Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3). 

#### Point Buy

You start with a -2 in all of your Attributes. You then gain 12 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**DC Tip:** Your Prime Modifier (see later in this chapter) comes from your highest Attribute, so it’s a good idea to make sure that you get a 3 in at least one of your Attributes.

#### Roll Method

You determine your starting values by rolling 1d6-3 four times, and then assign each value to an Attribute of your choice. You then gain +2 Attribute Points to increase whichever Attributes you want, up to the Attribute Limit (3).

**Prime Modifier Insurance:** If the value of your highest Attribute is less than 3 (even after adding the +2 Attribute Points), you can reduce a different Attribute value by 1 or more to increase your highest Attribute by the same amount. You can’t reduce an Attribute value below -2 or increase an Attribute above your Attribute Limit (3). 

**DC Tip:** This method of determining your starting Attributes is the most risky. It offers the potential for the highest starting Attributes, but also the lowest. If you add all your Attributes together, their sum should be 4 (on average), after the +2 bonus points are added. If you get less than this, talk to your GM about potentially rerolling your Attributes (or using a different method).

### Attribute Limit

You can increase your Attributes as you gain levels, but you can’t increase an Attribute past your Attribute Limit. Your Attribute Limit increases at certain levels as shown in the table below. You can increase an Attribute at the same level that your Attribute Limit increases.

| PC Level | Attribute Limit |
|----------|-----------------|
| 1        | +3              |
| 5        | +4              |
| 10       | +5              |
| 15       | +6              |
| 20       | +7              |

### Gaining Attributes

As your Player Character (PC) levels up they will regularly gain more Attribute Points to increase their Attributes. PCs gain +1 Attribute Point at levels 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, and 10 ("Player Character Progression Table" on page 92 for more information).

**DC Tip:** You get more of these points from levels 11 and higher as well!

### Prime Modifier

Your Prime Modifier represents your overall experience and prowess as an adventurer. You use your Prime Modifier as the primary bonus you add to Checks involving attacking, casting a Spell, or awareness of dangers around you. Your Prime Modifier is commonly associated with the following:

* Attack Checks (made to Attack with a Weapon or Unarmed Strike).
* Spell Checks (made to cast a Spell or use a supernatural ability).
* Save DCs (the difficulty of resisting the effects you impose on other creatures).
* Awareness Checks (your ability to perceive and detect things around you).

**DC Tip:** Just because the Barbarian in the group has high Charisma instead of Might doesn’t mean he’s worse at swinging a sword because of it.

### Prime Modifier Value

The value of your Prime Modifier is always equal to the value of your highest Attribute. If your highest Attribute changes, your Prime Modifier derives its value from the value of your new highest Attribute. Your Prime Modifier is not an Attribute, nor is it considered the Attribute that it derives its value from.

> **Example:** If Might is your highest Attribute, then your Prime Modifier derives its value from the value of your Might. If your Might is 3, then your Prime Modifier is 3. If an effect grants you ADV on Might Checks, it does not also grant you ADV on Checks that use your Prime Modifier (such as Attack Checks and Spell Checks) unless the effect otherwise says so.

!!! note "Prime Modifier Sidebar"

    The Prime Modifier allows you to create the kind of
    character you truly want to play without negatively
    impacting their combat prowess. Since your Prime
    Modifier will be used to swing weapons and cast
    Spells, this allows you to choose which Attribute you
    want to be the highest without feeling forced into
    picking a specific one. An Intelligent or Charismatic
    Barbarian may not have as much health or be able
    to grapple or lift as much as a Might Barbarian, but
    your ability to wield a weapon is the same.
    
    You can choose whether you roleplay the source of
    which Attribute your Prime Modifier comes from in
    Combat or not. It’s up to you. You could describe
    your intelligent Barbarian as being a tactical
    mastermind on the battlefield, or your charismatic
    Barbarian as a fiery confident leader, or you can be
    a mindless rage monster in Combat if you want to
    just smash things. This is an opportunity to create
    the PC you want.

### Variant Rules

#### Prime Modifier Equals Attribute Limit

Instead of the Prime Modifier being determined by a PC’s highest Attribute, it’s instead equal to their Attribute Limit. This means it will always be “maxed out”, no matter where you put your Attributes Points. This rule is designed for Players who want to create a PC that’s more well-rounded and doesn’t have one or two main Attributes they lean heavily on. This rule allows for Players to have more freedom in character creation, because their Prime Modifier will always start at 3 and progress with their level.

**DC Tip:** Be aware that if everyone in the group builds a balanced PC, then no one in the group will be the go to for certain activities or skills. This can ruin the nuanced group dynamics that TTRPG parties are often designed around, where every PC feels like they have a strong purpose that’s supported by mechanical advantages and not just narrative choices. If you like to have groups in which each PC gets their moments in the spotlight, then this might not be a rule for you.
