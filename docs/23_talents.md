# Talents

PCs gain Talents at specific levels (as shown in their Class Tables) to improve their statistics or to gain new abilities.

## Talent Types

There are 3 types of Talents:

* **Martial Talents:** Martial Talents enhance your physical abilities, allowing you to perform feats of heroic strength.
* **Spellcasting Talents:** Spellcasting Talents enhance your magical abilities, allowing you to cast Spells and produce other magical effects.
* **General Talents:** General Talents grant you general improvements, such as learning new Skills or increasing your Attributes.

## Talent Requirements

If a Talent has a requirement (such as a level requirement), you must meet that requirement to choose that Talent.

> DC Tip: The GM might also award Talents at key story moments or as rewards. Keep in mind however that these can be quite powerful, especially at early levels. 

## Talent Mastery Tables

When you choose a Talent, you gain additional benefits based on the Talent’s Type.

> DC Tip: You’ll always gain additional bonuses from one of these 2 tables. The Talent Type determines which rewards you get (or you can choose if it’s a General Talent). 

**Martial Talents:** When you gain a Martial Talent, you also gain the benefits listed on the Martial Talent Mastery Table.

**Spellcasting Talents:** When you gain a Spellcasting Talent, you also gain the benefits listed on the Spellcasting Talent Mastery Table.

**General Talents:** When you gain a General Talent, you also gain the benefits listed on the Martial Talent Mastery Table or Spellcasting Talent Mastery Table (your choice).

> Example: If a Fighter chooses a Martial Talent at level 2, they gain +1 SP, +1 Maneuver, and +1 Technique. If that Fighter chose a Spellcasting Talent instead, they would gain +2 MP, +1 Cantrip, and +1 Spell. 

### Martial Talent Mastery

## Multiclass Talents

Multiclass Talents allow you to gain Features from other Classes, except Flavor Features (see Class Flavor Features below). The Features you take will be of lower level than your own Class, but allow you to pick up powerful Features from other Classes and even Subclasses if you meet the requirements.

* **Martial Class Features:** If you gain a Feature from a Martial Class, it’s considered a Martial Talent for the purposes of Talent Mastery. Current Martial Classes: Barbarian, Commander, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, and Rogue.
* **Spellcasting Class Features:** If you gain a Feature from a Spellcasting Class, it’s considered a Spellcasting Talent for the purposes of Talent Mastery. Current Spellcasting Classes: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard.
* **Hybrid Class Features:** If you gain a Feature from a Hybrid Class, it’s considered a Martial Talent or Spellcasting Talent (your choice) for the purposes of Talent Mastery. Current Hybrid Class: Spellblade.

## Class Flavor Features

Once you gain 2 Class Features from the same Class, you automatically gain that Class’s Flavor Feature.

> Example: If a Wizard gains 2 Barbarian Features, they automatically gain the Barbarian’s Flavor Feature: Shattering Force. 

## Specific Damage Types

When you gain a Feature that references a damage type of a different Feature, you use that same damage type. If there are multiple choices of damage types to choose from, you must choose one when you gain the Feature.

> Example: The Cleric Feature Channel Divinity has an option (Censure Divine) that deals “Divine Damage” to nearby Celestials and Fiends. The Cleric normally choose their type of Divine Damage at level 1 when they gain the Cleric Order Feature. If a Fighter uses a Multiclassing Talent to gain the Channel Divinity Feature, they would need to choose a type of Divine Damage listed in the Cleric Order Feature.
