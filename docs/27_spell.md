# Premade Spell Lists

## Beta Spellcasting Premade Spell Lists

These are premade and curated Spell Lists that Classes can choose from. This is designed to be a placeholder for the FULL Spell Lists that were described in the Spellcasting section of the rules and in the Spellcasting Classes Mastery Features.

How this will work in the Beta Update is that you will pick Spells from your Spell List based on how many your Class Table allows you to get.

Additionally, the following Spells are placeholders for the Spells that will be released later as well. These are iconic Spells that you should recognize and were chosen to feel familiar as you learn how to play DC20. These will be updated and expanded upon in new and exciting directions, but I just wanted to make sure you can see the basics of what Spells will look and feel like.

Above each list are the Classes that can choose that list.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than 1 Space. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion because things can pass through it.
