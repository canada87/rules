## Warlock

Warlocks make a pact with a powerful entity that grants
them magic. Their body and soul are a part of this contract
and as such, they can tap into their own life force to enhance
and amplify their magic and capabilities as well as drain the
life force of other living creatures. They also choose a type
of pact to be made that grants more powers.

**Source of Power:** Warlocks gain their power through a pact
with a powerful entity. By making a deal with this entity
(and following the conditions), they gain access to magic
that they can channel as their own. Unlike a Cleric (who
believes in, follows, and has a true relationship with their
deity), Warlocks simply make a deal and have more of a
transactional or business relationship with their patron.
Pacts can be made with all sorts of entities of all ranges
of power levels as well, such as gods, devils, fey creatures,
otherworldly beings, dragons, and even other powerful
Warlocks.

**Warlock Flavor:** A Warlock pact could be made by choice
or by force, could be demanding or simple, and could be
made with a good, neutral, or evil entity (which might be
unknown by the Warlock). The Character might have to
accomplish certain tasks in order to keep their powers, or
the entity might take a more passive role and not ask much
from them.

During a Long Rest, while sleeping or meditating, you can
access an Inner Sanctum within your mind. Its appearance
is influenced by your psyche and is subject to change.
While inside your Inner Sanctum, you can attempt to
contact your Patron.

If they choose to respond, they enter your mind and
you might possibly be able to see or hear them. While
connected to your Patron in this way, you’re aware of your
surroundings but you can’t take actions or move. Your
Patron chooses when to end the connection, or you can
make a Mental Save against your own Save DC to force the
connection to end.

Your Inner Sanctum can look different depending on your
Patron. It could be in a foggy blackness, wreathed in flames,
or emitting a blinding light. Your Patron has full control
over your dream state and can shape the environment,
create landscapes, objects, creatures, and images.

> **DC Tip:** This is a narrative driven feature where the GM can
roleplay the Warlock’s Patron to grant information or even
mechanical boons to the character. GMs could choose to
give out situational or temporary Advantage or Disadvantage,
Spell effects like Bless / Bane, or even Inspiration depending
on your conversation with your Patron.
