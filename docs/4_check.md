# Checks

## Flat Attribute Checks

When a creature performs a task that doesn’t benefit from Mastery, then it makes a Flat Attribute Check (Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence). To make a Flat Attribute Check, roll a d20 and the associated Attribute to the result.

**Flat Attribute Check Formula:**
```
D20 + Attribute
```

> **Example:** A GM might ask a PC to make a Flat Agility Check to see how flexible they are or a Charisma Check to determine the first impression they make upon entering a room. If the PC’s Charisma is 4, they roll a d20 and add 4 to the result.

## Attack Checks

A creature can make an Attack Check when it takes the Attack Action or uses a Feature that calls for one. A creature must be wielding a Weapon or be capable of an Unarmed Strike to make an Attack Check. When a creature makes an Attack Check, it rolls a d20 then adds its Prime Modifier and Combat Mastery to determine the result.

**Attack Check Formula:**
```
D20 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery
```

> **Example:** A Level 4 Barbarian’s highest Attribute is a 3 (Prime Modifier) and their Combat Mastery is 2 (1/2 its level). When the Barbarian makes an Attack Check, they roll a d20 and add 5 (2+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result of the Attack Check is 15 (10 + 5). 

> **DC Tip:** Attack Checks are most often used when making Martial Attacks (see the Attacks & Defense chapter for more information).

## Spell Checks

A creature can make a Spell Check when it takes the Spell Action to cast a Spell or uses a Feature that calls for one. When a creature makes a Spell Check, it rolls a d20 then adds its Prime Modifier and Combat Mastery to determine the result.

**Spell Check Formula:**

```
D20 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery
```

> **Example:** A Level 6 Wizard’s highest Attribute is 4 (Prime Modifier) and has a Combat Mastery of 3 (1/2 its level). When the Wizard makes a Spell Check, they roll a d20 and add 7 (4+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result of the Spell Check is 17 (10 + 7).

> **DC Tip:** Spell Checks are most often used when Casting a Spell (see the Spellcasting Chapter for more information). Spell Checks are made against Defenses (Spell Attacks), Spell DCs, and Saves.


## Skill Checks

When a creature attempts a test of skill, the GM might have them make a Skill Check to determine whether they succeed or fail. The GM will choose the Skill to use with the Check based on the activity attempted.

### Making a Skill Check
To make a Skill Check, a creature rolls a d20, adds their Skill Mastery in the given Skill (if any), and adds the Attribute associated with the Skill. The result of the Skill Check is compared to the DC set by the GM. If the result of the Skill Check is equal to or higher than the DC, the Check is successful.

**Skill Check Formula:**

```
D20 + Attribute + Skill Mastery
```

> **Example:** A Level 4 Ranger’s Agility Attribute is 3 and their Skill Mastery in Stealth is Novice (+2). When the Ranger makes a Stealth Check to attempt to avoid being detected by other creatures, they roll a d20 and add 5 (3+2) to the result.

> **DC Tip:** Each Skill has a Base Attribute that is the “default” Attribute you would use for a given Check. See Variant Skill Checks in the Game Master Guide for more custom options for creative ways Attributes can be used with different Skills.

## Trade Checks

When a creature attempts a test of professional expertise, the GM might have them make a Trade Check to determine whether they succeed or fail. The GM will choose the Trade to use with the Check based on the activity attempted.

### Making a Trade Check
To make a Trade Check, a creature rolls a d20, adds their Trade Mastery in the given Trade (if any), and adds the Attribute associated with the Trade. The result of the Trade Check is compared to the DC set by the GM. If the result of the Trade Check is equal to or higher than the DC, then the Check is successful.

**Trade Check Formula:**

```
D20 + Attribute + Trade Mastery
```

> **Example:** A Level 5 Artificer’s Might Attribute is a 4 and their Trade Mastery in Blacksmithing is Adept (+4). When the Artificer makes a Blacksmithing Check to attempt to use Blacksmithing Tools to forge something, they roll a d20 and add 8 (4+4) to the result.

### Trade Tools
A creature must use the specified Trade Tools when attempting a Trade Check (see “Trades” on page 13 for more information on Trade Tools). If a creature attempts a Trade Check using tools not designed for the task (such as using a hair pin instead of Lockpicking Tools to pick a lock), they have DisADV on the Trade Check.

## Language Checks

When you’re trying to read, write, or speak in a language you have Limited Language Mastery in, you can make a Language Check to do so. Roll a d20 and add your Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) to the result.

**Language Check Formula:**

```
D20 + (Intelligence or Charisma)
```

### Language Check DC: 
The DC of a Language Check is determined by the type of language. DC 10 for Mortal, DC 15 for Exotic and Divine, and DC 20 for Outer.

> **DC Tip:** The GM will set a DC based on how hard it would be to read, write, or speak that language. The Halfling language would be easier to understand than Deep Speech for example.

## Special Checks

### Check Contests
When a creature makes a Check against an opposing creature’s Check or Save, they’re engaged in a Contest. The creature with the highest Check result is the winner of the Contest. If a Contest results in a tie, then the situation remains unchanged.

> **Example:** A Barbarian attempts to push a Rogue. If the Barbarian’s Check is higher than the Rogue’s Check, then the Rogue is pushed. If the Barbarian’s Check is lower than the Rogue’s Check, then the Rogue is not pushed. If the Barbarian’s Check is equal to the Rogue’s Check, then the Rogue is not pushed.

### Check Categories
Checks are organized into categories, such as: Attribute Checks, Physical Checks, Mental Checks, and Martial Checks. Some Checks fall within multiple Check Categories.

#### Attribute Checks
An Attribute Check includes any Check that uses an Attribute, such as:

- **Might Checks**: Flat Might Checks, Athletics Checks, and Intimidation Checks.
- **Agility Checks**: Flat Agility Checks, Acrobatics Checks, Trickery Checks, and Stealth Checks. 
- **Charisma Checks**: Flat Charisma Checks, Animal Checks, Influence Checks, and Insight Checks.
- **Intelligence Checks**: Flat Intelligence Checks, Investigation Checks, Medicine Checks, Survival Checks, Natural Checks, Arcane Checks, History Checks, Religion Checks, and Occultism Checks.

#### Physical Checks
A Physical Check includes any Check that requires a creature’s physicality to perform, such as Might Checks, Agility Checks, and Attack Checks.

#### Mental Checks
A Mental Check includes any Check that requires a creature’s focus to perform, such as Charisma Checks, Intelligence Checks, and Spell Checks.

#### Knowledge Checks
A Knowledge Check includes any Check that requires a creature to recall or discern information, such as Arcana Checks, History Checks, Nature Checks, Occultism Checks, and Religion Checks.

#### Martial Checks
When a creature performs a task that can benefit from either an Acrobatics or Athletics Check, the GM might call for a Martial Check instead. When a creature makes a Martial Check, it can choose to make an Acrobatics Check or an Athletics Check.

## Passive Skills

Sometimes a GM might not ask a PC to roll any dice to determine the
success of a Check. Instead, the GM would use the PC’s average result 
for that type of Check. Every Skill has a Passive value, such as 
Passive Awareness, Passive Insight, and Passive Athletics. 
The value of a Passive Skill is equal to 10 + all bonuses 
normally applied to its Check.

> **DC Tip:** A Level 1 Champion has 2 Levels of Mastery (+4
bonus) in Awareness, and its highest Attribute is 3 (Prime
Attribute). Normally it would make an Awareness Check by
rolling a d20 and adding 7 (4+3) to the Check, however its
Passive Awareness would instead by 17 (10+7). If a Rogue
attempts to sneak by the Champion (while they aren’t actively
looking), the Rogue would have to succeed a DC 17 Stealth
Check to avoid being detected

**Passive Skill Formula:**

```
10 + all bonuses
```

> **Example:** A Level 1 Fighter has 2 Levels of Mastery (+4 bonus) in Awareness, and its highest Attribute is 3 (Prime Attribute). Normally it would make an Awareness Check by rolling a d20 and adding 7 (4+3) to the Check. However, its Passive Awareness would instead by 15 (8+7). If a Rogue attempts to sneak by the Fighter (while they aren’t actively looking), the Rogue would have to succeed on a DC 15 Stealth Check to avoid being detected.

### Permanent ADV and DisADV
If you have an effect that grants you a permanent ADV or
DisADV to a Skill Check, then you add (ADV) or subtract
(DisADV) 2 to your Passive Skill for each instance of
ADV or DisADV.

> **Example:** The Commander has Heavy Armor and has
DisADV on all Stealth Checks they make. Since this is a
permanent effect (as long as they’re wearing that armor),
you would also subtract 2 from the Commander’s Passive
Stealth Skill.
