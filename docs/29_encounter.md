# Encounter Planning

Balancing an encounter with multiple monsters involves carefully adjusting their Health and Action Points to create a challenging yet fair experience for the players. By fine-tuning Health and Action Points, you create a balanced, engaging encounter that tests the players' skills and teamwork without making the battle feel unwinnable or too easy.

## Encounter Health

Overall monster Health can be tailored based on the number of monsters and their roles in the encounter. For example, if the encounter includes a mix of Minions, Low-tier, and Mid-tier monsters, the Minions might have minimal Health to be quickly dispatched, Low-tier monsters might have moderate Health to survive a turn or two, and Mid-tier monsters would have enough Health to withstand several rounds of combat. This ensures that players face a variety of threats that require different strategies without overwhelming them.

The overall Health of all monsters in a level 1 Encounter should be 10 times the number of PCs. If you have 4 PCs, then the overall monster Health should be 40 HP. This increases to 15 times the number of PCs for a level 2 Encounter.

Level 1: Number of PCs x 10 = Monster HP Total
Level 2: Number of PCs x 15 = Monster HP Total

## Encounter Action Points

AP is equally crucial in balancing encounters. By adjusting the number of Actions a monster can take each turn, you control the pacing and intensity of the battle. Minions might have a single Action, making them straightforward but still potentially dangerous in numbers. Low and Mid-tier monsters could have 2 or more Actions, allowing them to Move, Attack, or use special abilities, thus providing a more dynamic threat. High-tier monsters and Bosses might have multiple Actions per turn, making them formidable opponents that require the party to prioritize and strategize. Solo monsters, designed to challenge an entire party, can have a plethora of Actions, representing their power and keeping the players on their toes throughout the encounter.

The overall AP of all monsters in any Encounter should be 4 times the number of PCs. If you have 4 PCs, then the overall Action Points should be 16 AP (total of each Monsterâ€™s AP added together).
