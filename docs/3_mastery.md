## Mastery

Mastery represents your level of competency within different categories. When you have Mastery with something (such as Skill, Trade, or Language), you gain certain bonuses to actions that use that Mastery. Conversely, when you lack Mastery with something you may suffer certain penalties (such as adding no bonuses to those rolls).

### Mastery Types

There are several types of Mastery:

* **Skill Mastery:** Your Mastery with certain skill sets, such as Awareness, Stealth, and Investigation. These are Skills used to interact with the environment and the creatures that inhabit it.
* **Trade Mastery:** Your Mastery with certain professions, such as Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, and Artistry. These are Trades used to craft goods and provide services.
* **Language Mastery:** Your fluency with certain Languages. This Mastery is used to govern how well you can read, write, speak, and understand different Languages.
* **Combat Mastery:** Your prowess on the battlefield, such as Attacks, Defenses, and Saves. This Mastery represents your general ability to fight and survive against other creatures.

#### Gaining Masteries

You can gain Mastery from your Class, Class Features, Subclass Features, Ancestry Traits or Talents. You will have opportunities at character creation and when your PC levels up to select a variety of options to gain any of these Masteries.

### Skill Mastery

Skill Mastery represents your proficiency with a Skill. There are several Skill Mastery Levels, ranging from Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Skill Mastery grants greater bonuses to the Skill Checks in which you have Mastery. See **Skills** for more information on the different Skills.

#### Skill Mastery Levels

There are 5 Skill Mastery Levels. You can spend Skill Points to increase your Skill Mastery Level in a given Skill, up to the maximum Skill Mastery Level of 5 (Grandmaster). Each Skill Mastery Level grants you a +2 bonus on the respective Skill Checks. The table below shows the bonuses granted by the different Skill Mastery Levels.

| Mastery Level | Mastery Bonus |
|---|---|
| 1 - Novice | +2 |
| 2 - Adept | +4 |
| 3 - Expert | +6 |
| 4 - Master | +8 |
| 5 - Grandmaster | +10 |

> **Example:** If you have 2 Skill Mastery Levels in the Athletics Skill (Adept), you add a +4 bonus (+2 per Level) to any Athletics Check you make. See **Checks & Saves** for more information on making Skill Checks.

##### Skill Mastery Limit

You can spend Skill Points to gain Skill Mastery, up to your Skill Mastery Limit. Your Skill Mastery Limit starts at Novice and increases based on your Character Level as shown in the table below.

| Character Level | Mastery Limit |
|---|---|
| 1 | Novice |
| 5 | Adept |
| 10 | Expert |
| 15 | Master |
| 20 | Grandmaster |

> **Example:** If a PC has a Skill Mastery Limit of Adept, they can allocate up to 2 Skill Points into a single Skill, such as the Awareness Skill. If that PC has additional Skill Points to allocate, they can’t allocate them into the Awareness Skill until their Skill Mastery Limit increases to Expert or higher.

#### Gaining Skill Mastery

You can gain Skill Mastery from Skill Points or directly from Skill Mastery Increases.

##### Skill Points

You gain Skill Points from your Background, Class, Intelligence (if it’s positive), and possibly from Talents you choose.

* **Talent Skills:** Some Talents (such as Skill Increase) grant additional Skill Points.
* **Intelligence Skills:** You gain a number of Skill Points equal to your Intelligence. If your Intelligence is negative, then your total Skill Points is reduced by the same amount. If your Intelligence changes, your total Skill Points change by an equal amount.

##### Skill Mastery Increases

You can gain Skill Mastery directly through Class Features and Ancestry Traits.

* **Class Skills:** Some Classes (such as Ranger) grant Skill Mastery based on chosen Feature options.
* **Ancestry Skills:** Some Ancestries (such as Humans) grant Skill Mastery.

##### Gaining Knowledge Skill Mastery

When you spend a Skill Point on a Knowledge Skill (Arcana, History, Nature, Occultism, and Religion), you gain a bonus Skill Point that you can allocate to the same Skill or a different Knowledge Skill, up to your Skill Mastery Limit.

#### Lacking Skill Mastery

When you make a Skill Check using a Skill in which you lack Mastery, you don’t gain a Skill Mastery bonus on the Check.

**DC Tip:** Certain abilities might require a certain level of Mastery to perform, or other passive abilities might be granted to those of different Mastery Levels. There are a lot of possibilities here.

### Trade Mastery

Trade Mastery represents your proficiency with a Trade. There are several Trade Mastery Levels, ranging from Novice to Grandmaster. Each increasing Level of Trade Mastery grants greater bonuses to the Trade Checks in which you have Mastery. See **Trades** for more information on the different Trades.

**DC Tip:** Certain abilities might require a certain level of Mastery to perform, or other passive abilities might be granted to those of different Mastery Levels. There are a lot of possibilities here.

### Language Mastery

Language Mastery grants you levels of proficiency speaking different languages. If you don’t have Language Mastery in a given language, then you’re unable to speak or understand that language. Gaining Language Mastery in a given language allows you to speak that language with greater levels of fluency.

#### Language Mastery Levels

Language Mastery represents your fluency with a Language. There are only 2 Language Mastery Levels: Limited and Fluent. See **Languages** for more information on the different Languages.

| Mastery Level | Fluency |
|---|---|
| 0 - None | You don't know the language. |
| 1 - Limited | You can read, write, and speak the language, but you must make a Language Check and succeed to do so. |
| 2 - Fluent | You can read, write, and speak the language fluently. |

> **Example:** If you have 1 level of Language Mastery (Limited) in the Goblin Language, then you can make a Language Check to attempt to read, write, speak, or understand the Goblin Language. Alternatively, 2 levels of Language Mastery (Fluent) would allow you to do so without needing to make a Check. See **Checks & Saves** for more information on making Language Checks.

**DC Tip:** There is more of a progression to learning a language and there are more subtle interactions that happen both from a roleplay standpoint and a mechanics standpoint.

#### Language Mastery Limit

There is no Mastery Limit for Languages. You can use Language Points to increase your Language Mastery in as many Languages as there are available to you, there is no limit on how many points you can put into a Language.

#### Gaining Language Mastery

You are Fluent in Common. You can gain additional Language Mastery using Language Points.

##### Language Points

You gain Language Points from your Background, and possibly from Talents you choose.

* **Background Languages:** Your Background grants you Common Fluency and 2 Language Points.
* **Talent Languages:** Some Talents (such as Trade Increase) grant additional Trade Points, which you can convert to Language Points (see below).

##### Converting Trade Points to Language Points

You can convert 1 Trade Point into 2 Language Point (but not the other way around).

**DC Tip:** Trade Points spent on Languages are worth double, just like how Skill Points spent on Knowledge Skills are worth double.

#### Lacking Language Mastery

If you don’t have Language Mastery with a Language, you can’t read, write, speak or understand it.

### Combat Mastery (CM)

Combat Mastery represents your experience in dealing
with dangers and overcoming adversaries in Combat. Your
Combat Mastery equals half your Character Level (rounded
up), which you add to the following combat statistics:
Physical Defense, Mystical Defense, Attack Checks, Spell
Checks, Attribute Saves (depends), and your Save DC.

**Combat Mastery Formula:**

```
1/2 your Character’s Level (rounded up)
```

#### Gaining Combat Mastery

You have Combat Mastery with the following:

- Attack Checks and Spell Checks
- Physical Defense and Mystical Defense
- Save DC

You gain Combat Mastery with 2 Attribute Saves (Might,
Agility, Intelligence, or Charisma) from your Background.
Your Class or Ancestry might also grant Combat Mastery
with Attribute Saves.

#### Lacking Combat Mastery

If you lack Combat Mastery with a statistic, you don’t add
your Combat Mastery to that statistic.

> **DC Tip:** You don’t have Combat Mastery with Death Saves, so those Saves don’t add your CM.

equipment effectively in Combat. You can gain Combat
Training with the following types of equipment: Weapons,
Armor, and Shields.

#### Gaining Combat Training

Martial Classes grant Weapon Training.
