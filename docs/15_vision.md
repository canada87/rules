## Line of Sight

Line of Sight refers to a creature being able to see something within their field of view. If a PC watches a creature run behind a castle wall, that creature is no longer in the PC’s Line of Sight.

On a grid map, this would mean that you can draw a straight line from any one corner of the Space that you’re on, to any one corner of a Space that the other creature is on. If you can see a creature but they’re partially behind something (a wall, another creature, etc.), then they have Cover (see below).

## Cover

**1/2 Cover:** Creatures have a -2 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target’s PD while the target is behind 1/2 Cover.

A creature benefits from 1/2 Cover when it’s hiding behind a chair, a small table, or another creature of the same size or larger.

**3/4 Cover:** Creatures have a -5 penalty on Attack Checks and Spell Checks against a target’s PD while the target is behind 3/4 Cover.

A creature benefits from 3/4 Cover when it’s hiding behind a large piece of furniture, it’s hiding behind a creature 2 or more sizes larger than it, or if it’s partially covered by a wall.

**Full Cover:** Creatures can’t make Attack Checks or Spell Checks against a target’s PD while the target is behind Full Cover.

A creature benefits from Full Cover when it’s completely behind an object that’s larger than them.

## Concealment

**Partially Concealed:** A creature is Partially Concealed while within an area of thin fog, moderate foliage, or Dim Light. Creatures have DisADV on Awareness Checks made to see things that are Partially Concealed.

**Fully Concealed:** A creature is Fully Concealed while in an area that blocks vision entirely, such as Darkness, thick fog, or dense foliage. Creatures are considered Blinded for the purposes of seeing things that are Fully Concealed.

## Illumination

The illumination of an area can affect a creature’s ability to see. There are 3 levels of illumination: Bright Light, Dim Light, and Darkness. Unless otherwise stated, this book assumes all creatures are in an area of Bright Light.

Anytime a source of light produces Bright Light with a listed radius, then that source of light also produces Dim Light that extends out an equal distance beyond the Bright Light. Beyond the radius of Dim Light is only Darkness, unless there’s another source of light illuminating the area.

> **Example:** If a campfire produces Bright Light with a 5 Space radius, then it also produces Dim Light with a 5 Space radius. The result is that the campfire produces 5 Spaces of Bright Light followed by another 5 Spaces of Dim Light in all directions.

### Bright Light

Bright Light fully illuminates everything within its area, allowing creatures to see normally. Most sources of mundane fire produce an area of Bright Light, such as torches, lanterns, or campfires.

**Sunlight:** Sunlight is a special form of Bright Light that illuminates the land while the sun is present in the sky. Some creatures, such as Vampires, suffer penalties while in an area of Sunlight.

### Dim Light

Dim Light only partially illuminates an area, allowing creatures to see with difficulty. Dim Light fills the area between the boundaries of Bright Light and Darkness. The area covered by a shadow, the light of a full moon, and the light produced by dusk and dawn are all examples of Dim Light.

**Seeing in Dim Light:** Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see normally in Dim Light, they perceive things within Dim Light as Partially Concealed (DisADV on Awareness Checks to see them).

> **Example:** A creature carries a torch that sheds 3 Spaces of Bright Light followed by another 3 spaces of Dim Light in all directions. The creature can see things within the Bright Light normally, making Awareness Checks as called for by the GM. However, the creature has DisADV on any Awareness Checks it makes to see things that are within the Dim Light.

### Darkness

Darkness is an area that lacks any form of illumination, making it impossible for creatures to see. Areas in nighttime between dusk and dawn, an unlit room, or an underground tunnel are examples of Darkness.

**Seeing in Darkness:** Unless a creature has Darkvision or another means to see partially or normally in Darkness, they perceive things within Darkness as Fully Concealed (Blinded to see them). While in an area of Darkness, a creature can’t see anything within the area, but it can still see areas of Dim Light or Bright Light that are within its Line of Sight.

> **Example:** A creature is in an area of Darkness that extends in all directions as far as the horizon, making them unable to see anything at all, including themselves. However, if a source of light were produced somewhere within the creature’s Line of Sight (such as a distant campfire), the creature would remain Blinded to all things except that area of illumination (whether Dim Light or Bright Light).

### Magical Light & Darkness

There are also sources of Magical Light and Magical Darkness coming out in the Beta.

## Vision

### Darkvision

Creatures with Darkvision have the ability to see in Dim Light and Darkness out to a specified range. A creature with Darkvision can see areas of Dim Light within the specified range as if it were Bright Light, and see areas of Darkness within the specified range as if it were Dim Light. A creature can’t discern color using their Darkvision, only shades of gray.

> **Example:** A creature with Darkvision 10 can see up to 10 Spaces in Dim Light as if it were Bright Light, and up to 10 Spaces in Darkness as if it were Dim Light.

### Tremorsense

Creatures with Tremorsense can sense vibrations in the ground within a specified range, allowing them to automatically pinpoint the location of anything that’s in contact with the same surface, including through Cover and Concealment. Creatures with Tremorsense and a Swim Speed can also pinpoint the location of creatures moving through water within the specified range.

### Blindsight

Creatures with Blindsight have the ability to see things within a specified range without the use of eyes. Creatures without eyes or that can see using echolocation are able to see things using Blindsight. A creature with Blindsight can see things that are Invisible, is immune to being Blinded, and can see unimpeded by Concealment. Blindsight doesn’t grant a creature the ability to see behind Cover.

> **Example:** A creature with Blindsight 5 can see up to 5 Spaces in any direction as if they could see normally. This includes Invisible creatures within range and creatures that are Partially or Fully Concealed within range that aren’t behind Cover.

### Truesight

Creatures with Truesight have the ability to see things that are normally imperceptible out to a specified range. They can see through normal and Magical Darkness, see into the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane (and vice versa), see things that are Invisible, automatically see through illusions, and can perceive the true form of a Shapechanger or creature that’s transformed by magic.

> **Example:** A creature with Truesight 10 can see up to 10 Spaces in Darkness normally, see creatures within range that are Invisible or on the Ethereal Plane, and see the true form of any creature that is shapeshifted.
