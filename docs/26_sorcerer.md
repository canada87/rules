## Sorcerer

Sorcerers tap into the raw magic in their own bodies as a
conduit to harness, manipulate, and sculpt magic with
wild resolve. They can overload themselves and even cast
Spells without Mana, pushing the limits of magic and
their own bodies.

**Source of Power:** A Sorcerer’s magic is in their blood,
allowing them to tap into it naturally and use it in ways
others can’t. This could come from a lineage of angels,
dragons, demons, or something else. Some Sorcerers’
power could come from an incident that caused their body
to be suffused with magic (such as a magical explosion, a
blessing, or curse).
