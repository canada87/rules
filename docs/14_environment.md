# Environment

## Spaces & Distance

Distance is measured using Spaces, like the Spaces on a Grid Map. A Space can be measured in feet or meters, where 1 Space is equal to 5 feet or 1.5 meters.

> DC Tip: 1 Foot is roughly 30 Centimeters, so you can quickly convert from Feet to Centimeters by multiplying the number of Feet by 30.

**Grid Map Distance:** When moving or measuring distance on a gridded map, moving in any direction counts as 1 Space (including moving diagonally). You can alternatively measure in straight lines between points if you have the measuring tools or templates to do so.

> Example: The normal range of a Longbow is 30 Spaces. To determine its range on a Grid Map just count 30 Spaces in any direction. The Longbow’s range could also be expressed as 150ft or 45m.

When tracking distance across long distances, such as from one town to another, you might want to measure distance using feet or meters instead.

> DC Tip: Using Spaces to track distance in Combat makes things easier for determining how far a creature can move or the range of an effect. If something has a range of 10 Spaces, then that’s 10 Spaces on the Grid Map.

## Difficult Terrain

Some terrain is more difficult to move through due to obstacles in the way (such as plants, rocks, fallen debris, other creatures, etc.). This type of terrain is more difficult to traverse than normal.

While moving through Difficult Terrain, you are Slowed (every 1 Space moved costs 2 Spaces of movement).

## Jumping

Jumping is a form of movement. A creature must have means of gaining movement in order to perform a jump. 

If a creature does not have enough movement to jump the maximum distance possible, its jump distance is shortened to the maximum movement available.

There are two types of jumps: a Long Jump and a High Jump. A Long Jump represents the distance a creature can move while jumping horizontally, and a High jump represents the distance a creature’s feet can reach above the ground when jumping vertically.

### Jump Distance

A creature’s Jump Distance is equal to its Agility (minimum of 1).

**Jump Distance = Agility**

*   **Running Jump:** After moving at least 2 Spaces, a creature can perform a Long Jump (horizontal jump) or a High Jump (vertical jump). If performing a Long Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in Spaces. If performing a High Jump, it can jump its Jump Distance in feet (1ft = 30cm).
*   **Standing Jump:** A creature can forgo moving at least 2 Spaces before performing a jump, however its maximum Jump Distance is halved for the jump.

#### Long Jump

**Long Jump = Jump Distance (in Spaces)**

> Long Jump Example: A creature has a Jump Distance of 3. If that creature takes the Move Action to gain 4 Spaces of movement, it can move 2 Spaces before performing a Long Jump that can cover up to 2 Spaces (Jump Distance). It would need to take the Move Action again (gaining 4 more Spaces of movement) to have enough movement to jump the full 3 Spaces possible.

> DC Tip: Basically, if you have a Jump Distance of 5 it does NOT mean that when you jump, you can automatically jump 5 Spaces (that would be broken). Jump Distance is the number of Spaces you can cover in a single jump. You need to have enough movement (from taking the Move Action, or etc.) to cover that distance.

#### High Jump

**High Jump = Jump Distance (in Feet)**

> High Jump Example: A creature has a Jump Distance of 3. If that creature takes the Move Action to gain 4 Spaces of movement, it can move 2 Spaces to perform a High Jump that can reach up to 3ft (90cm) above the ground.

### Vertical Reach

The maximum height a creature can reach with its arms is equal to 1.5 times its height. A creature with a height of 6ft (1.8m) can reach something 9ft (2.7m) above the ground with its arms. A creature’s reach is added to its High Jump when determining how high it can reach during the jump.

## Falling

When a creature begins falling, it immediately falls up to 100 Spaces or until it hits the ground.

**Falling Damage:** When a creature falls from a height more than its Agility in Spaces (minimum of 1 Space) and collides with the ground, an object, or a creature it takes True damage equal to the number of Spaces it fell (up to a maximum of 100 damage).

**Reduced Impact:** A creature that’s going to take damage from Falling can make an Acrobatics Check to potentially reduce the Falling damage and avoid falling Prone. The DC equals 10 + 1 per each Space it falls. 

* **Success:** It reduces the damage by an amount equal to its Agility (minimum of 0).
* **Failure:** It falls Prone.

> Example: If a PC has an Agility of 2 and falls from a height of 2 Spaces, they can make a DC 12 (10 + a 2 Space Fall) Acrobatics Check, and on a Success they take 0 damage (2 Space Fall - 2 Agility = 0 damage). If that same PC falls from a height of 3 Spaces, they can make a DC 13 Acrobatics Check, and on a Success they take 1 True damage (3 Space Fall - 2 Agility = 1 damage).

### Controlled Falling

If you’re falling intentionally and are in control of your body and movement, it’s considered a Controlled Fall. There are no additional penalties to falling in this way.

### Uncontrolled Falling

If you’re thrown off a ledge, knocked back from an explosion, unable to react, or are restrained in some way when falling, it’s considered an Uncontrolled Fall (GM discretion).

**Uncontrolled Impact:** If you’re uncontrollably falling, the DC of Reduced Impact increases by 5. Additionally, you take damage when falling from any height (regardless of your Agility).

> Example: If a PC has an Agility of 3 and has a Controlled Fall from a height of 3 Spaces, they can make a DC 13 Acrobatics Check, and on a Success they take 0 damage (3 Space Fall - 3 Agility = 0 damage). If that same PC has an Uncontrolled Fall from a height of 3 Spaces, they would make a DC 18 (DC 13 + 5) Acrobatics Check instead.

### Continuous Falling

If you’re still falling at the end of your turn, you immediately fall another 100 Spaces.

### Falling While Flying

If you’re knocked Prone while flying, you immediately fall up to 100 Spaces unless you are magically held aloft. If you are still falling at the start of your turn, you can spend 2 Spaces of movement to end the Prone Condition on yourself (as if standing up in mid air).

## Climbing

Creatures that lack a Climb Speed are Slowed while climbing. A creature can climb a ladder, a knotted rope, or along a pocketed wall without requiring a Climbing Check (Athletics). Climbing a slick rope or wall may require a Climbing Check. Creatures with a Climb Speed have ADV on Climbing Checks. The table below provides guidance on setting the DC for challenging climbs. 
* **Failure:** The creature immediately falls.

| Difficulty | DC 10 |
| :-------- |:------|
| Soft or Mushy | +5    |
| Wet or Icy | +5    |
| Flat | +10   |
| Upside Down | +10   |

> DC Tip: Climbing great distances can be challenging, so the GM may ask a PC to make a DC 10 Climbing Check for every 5 Spaces they climb beyond the first 5 Spaces, even if the rope or surface is normally easy to climb short distances. Creatures with Climbing Speeds wouldn’t need to make these Checks.

## Swimming

Creatures that lack a Swim Speed are Slowed while swimming. A creature can swim for 20 Spaces (100ft / 30m) in still waters without requiring a Swimming Check (Athletics). Swimming in a turbulent body of water without a Swim Speed requires a Swimming Check. The table below provides guidance on setting the DC for challenging swims. 
* **Failure:** The creature fails to move and sinks 2 Spaces into the body of water.

| Difficulty | DC 10 |
| :-------- |:------|
| Choppy | +5    |
| Icy | +5    |
| Swampy | +5    |
| Stormy | +10   |

> DC Tip: Swimming great distances can be challenging, so the GM may ask a PC to make a DC 10 Swimming Check for every 20 Spaces they swim beyond the first 20 Spaces, even if the water is still. Creatures with Swimming Speeds wouldn’t need to make these Checks.

## Holding Your Breath

Creatures that require air to breathe can hold their breath to avoid breathing in toxic air, drowning underwater, or suffocating in an airless vacuum. A creature that can no longer hold its breath begins Suffocating. The amount of time a creature can hold its breath depends on the type of stress they’re exposed to and the energy they’re exerting.

There are two types of measures to hold your breath: a Calm Hold and a Stressed Hold. A Calm Hold represents the duration a creature can hold its breath while in a low stress environment while doing little to no activity, and a Stressed Hold represents the time a creature can hold its breath while in a high stress environment while doing lots of activity.

### Breath Duration

A creature’s Breath Duration is equal to its Might (minimum of 1).

**Breath Duration = Might**

#### Calm Hold

**Calm Hold = Breath Duration (in Minutes)**

A creature that’s performing No Activity or Light Activity in a calm environment can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to its Breath Duration. If a creature begins performing any Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity, any remaining minutes of air is converted to an equal number of rounds.

> Calm Hold Example: A creature has a Breath Duration of 3. If that creature decides to hold its breath while standing still in a calm environment, it can hold its breath for up to 3 minutes.

*   **No Activity:** Lying down, meditating, or contemplating while idle.
*   **Light Activity:** Non-strenuous activity that requires little effort such as reading, bandaging wounds, and standing watch.

#### Stressed Hold

**Stressed Hold = Breath Duration (in Rounds)**

A creature that is performing Strenuous Activity or Dangerous Activity can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to its Breath Duration.

> Stressed Hold Example: A creature has a Breath Duration of 3. If that creature decides to hold its breath while fighting a sea monster underwater, it can hold its breath for up to 3 rounds or 36 seconds (1 round is 12 seconds).

*   **Strenuous Activity:** Any activity that requires physical exertion, such as traveling, foraging, exercising, training, or casting Spells.
*   **Dangerous Activity:** Any activity that causes extreme injury or stress, such as engaging in combat with a hostile creature.

> DC Tip: Remember, 1 Round in Combat is 12 seconds… that means that 1 minute is equal to 5 Rounds of Combat.

### Losing Your Breath

*   **Speaking:** Creatures that attempt to speak while holding their breath, such as to satisfy the Verbal Component require to cast a Spell, reduce their Breath Duration by 1.
*   **Knocking the Wind Out:** Whenever you take damage, you must make a Might Save. The DC equals 10 or twice the damage taken (whichever is higher). 
    * **Failure:** You lose 1 round of air.

> DC Tip: Certain effects and abilities can cause a creature to begin Suffocating immediately, usually by knocking the air out of a creature or by constricting it.

## Suffocating

At the start of each of your turns, you suffer the following effects while you’re Suffocating:

*   **Loss of Consciousness:** You must make a DC 10 Might Save. 
    * **Failure:** You fall Unconscious. 
    * **Success:** You remain conscious, but the DC increases by 5.
*   **HP Reduction:** You take an amount of True damage equal to 1/4 your HP maximum.

These effects can’t be reversed by any means until you regain the ability to breathe again.
