## Hunter

Hunters are master survivalists and natural explorers. They
mark their targets to better track them and take them down,
using their mastery over terrain, traps, and weapons to
their advantage.

**Source of Power:** Hunters use their experience and
knowledge of the dangers of nature and the creatures that
live within it. They can adapt to all sorts of environments
and use what they learn to their advantage.

### Subclass: Trapper

#### Dynamic Traps

You are able to use a variety of supplies to craft traps.

* **Creating Traps:** You can have a maximum number of
Hunter’s Traps equal to your Prime Modifier at any time.
During a Long Rest, you can craft a number of Traps equal
to your Prime Modifier. You can make 1 additional Trap as
part of a Short Rest. These Traps use your Save DC when
they force a creature to make a Save or when a Check is
made to interact with them.

* **Setting a Trap:** You can spend 1 AP to Set and Hide one of
your Traps in a Space within 5 Spaces that doesn’t already
contain a Trap. The Trap is Hidden to creatures, and the
DC to discover or disarm the Trap is equal to your Save DC.
When you do, you can spend 1 SP to add the damage and
effect of one of your Hunter’s Strike options to the Trap.
Once Set, your Traps are unstable and fall apart harmlessly
after 1 hour.

> **DC Tip:** Attacks made while Hidden have ADV against
unaware creatures. Hidden Traps have ADV on Attacks.

* **Triggering a Trap:** A Trap is Triggered when a creature
other than you enters or leaves a Space occupied by the
Trap. Alternatively, you can spend 1 AP to Trigger a Trap
within 5 Spaces. When Triggered, the Trap makes an Attack
for free against the PD of a creature in its Space using your
Attack Check. This Attack ignores your Multiple Check
Penalty and doesn’t progress that penalty.
* **Hit:** The Trap deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing
damage (your choice when you Set the Trap) equal to
your Prime Modifier, plus the damage and effects of your
Hunter’s Strike (if used when you Set the Trap).
* **Recovering a Trap:** You can spend 1 AP while within 1
Space of one of your Set Traps to disarm and recover the
use of the Trap. When you do, it loses any damage and
effects of your Hunter’s Mark (if applicable).

> **Example:** A Hunter lays down a Trap 5 Spaces away and
chooses the Piercing damage option. They choose to spend
1 SP to add the Fire option from Hunter’s Strike to the Trap.
When the Trap is triggered, it makes an Attack Check to deal
Prime Piercing damage and 2 Fire damage as well as forcing
a Save against the Burning Condition.

#### Discerning Eye (Flavor Feature)
You have ADV on Awareness Checks to discover Hidden
Traps and on Investigation Checks to discern how to
disarm them.
