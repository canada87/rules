# Game Master Tips

These are just tips on running Combat in DC20. There’s SO much I have on this, but I just wanted to get these out to y'all here!

## Monster Action Point Tips

A big concern that some of my team had when developing DC20 was the GM tracking Action Points (AP) for multiple monsters. So, here are some tips on how I handle it. After a TON of playtesting, I feel that it’s very simple to do. Each GM just needs to find what methods work best for them. 

Usually I do NOT use any of these methods, because I can generally remember if a monster has taken any Reactions or not. However, when I run a Combat Encounter with a lot of monsters or lots of things going on, then I do use some of these methods to help me keep track of things.

> **DC Tip:** My biggest tip here is to limit how many REACTIONS you give your monsters. If a monster doesn't have any Reactions… then they’re SUPER easy to run. As you get more practice you can start to add more and more Reactions to your monsters.

### Tally Marks

This is my preferred method. Next to the monster's name on my Initiative Tracker (a piece of paper I write the Initiative Order on), I’ll simply put a tally mark next to a monster that has spent AP as a Reaction. Once the monster's turn comes, I can see how many tally marks it used, erase them, and reduce the amount of AP they have by that amount.

> **Example:** If a Goblin spends 2 AP on Reactions, then I’d have 2 tally marks next to its name. Once its turn comes, I’d subtract the number of tally marks (2) from the AP of the Goblin (4) and would know he only has 2 left.

Most of the time you don’t have monsters taking a lot of Reactions, so you normally won't even have to use tally marks.

### Use Dice

I have used a d4 or a d6 and placed it behind my GM Screen next to the monster's name on the Initiative Order (where I write it down on a piece of paper). I put the die next to their name and leave it with the 4 facing up. Once a monster uses a Reaction of some kind, I turn it to a 3 and place it back down on the paper initiative tracker next to the monster's name. Once that monster's turn comes, I see there’s a die with a 3 next to it and remember that it has 3 AP.

You could place the die out on the battlefield next to the monster instead, but I find that this method clutters the map. If you use VTTs, you can track it easily on the monsters digitally.

### Glass Beads / Gems / Tokens

If you like having tangible things to play with, then behind your screen you can have a number of little tokens to represent the AP of each monster. This makes it VERY easy to track, but it can get messy behind your screen. Because of that, I personally only use this method for Legendary Monsters (and their Legendary Reaction Points).

## Monster Combos

If you pre-plan for monsters to have a “signature move”, or just a combo of actions to spend their AP on, then it can make running them SO much easier. You can also have a tactical plan in place with multiple monsters that work together.

> **Example:** In one combat I ran, I had a pair of mercenary brothers. One had a whip and the other had huge boulder gauntlets. The whip brother would constantly use Maneuvers to try to knock the target Prone, while the other brother would always pour ALL of his AP into ONE really big hit. Their playstyles played into their personalities, too.

## Alternative Monster Action Economy

I personally haven’t had to do this (because I feel like Action Points are simple enough), BUT if you want to have monsters function a bit more like in other systems, you can try this. Instead of your monsters having a default of 4 AP, you make it to where they have 3 AP and 1 Reaction. It might be more familiar to keep track of one Reaction than tracking individual AP use from Reactions.

## Legendary Monsters

You can add some of these features onto a monster to make them feel even scarier. You could even give these Features to a simple Goblin Chief, or other smaller creatures. I don't want you to reserve the concept of “legendary” for only final bosses, dragons, or other powerful creatures. Sprinkle these in on ANY monster!

### Legendary Action Points (LAP)

Legendary Action Points work similar to how you have used them in other systems, and they actually fit into DC20 very smoothly. You can spend LAP in between the PCs’ turns. This lets these monsters act more often and in more dynamic ways.

*   **Turn Limit:** You can’t spend Legendary Action Points during your turn in the Initiative Order.
*   **Number of Points:** You can give a monster any number of these (usually no more than the number of PCs).
*   **Recharge:** They recharge at the beginning of each Round of Combat.
*   **Interrupt Initiative Order:** You can spend Legendary Action Points in between any PC’s turns. After a PC’s turn in Combat, you can spend 1 Legendary Action Point to take any Action that costs 1 AP (unless stated otherwise).
*   **Enhancements & Maneuvers:** You can spend AP or LAP to enhance Maneuvers and Spells. Just make sure you keep track of which one you’re spending.

### Example Scenarios

*   If a Legendary Monster wants to take an Opportunity Attack, Spell Duel, or any other normal Reaction, they can spend Legendary Action Points instead of their normal Action Points. This lets them save their (usually 4) Action Points to use on their turn, so they have a “full” turn.
*   If a Legendary Monster makes an Opportunity Attack and they want to enhance it by spending more on it, they can use either their Action Points OR their Legendary Action Points to boost it.
*   Some Legendary Monsters might have a unique Reaction that lets them do something cool… when they take that Reaction, they can spend either AP or LAP on it.

## Boss Points

> **Beta Note:** These are similar to the concept of “Legendary Resistance”. They are points that Legendary Monsters can have that lets them do unique things, but only a limited number of times.

Creatures can have any number of Boss Points (usually between 1-3) and can spend them on some of the ideas listed below. Additionally, creatures can have unique effects (offensive, defensive, utility, etc.) that spend Boss Points that the GM can choose to use them on. Boss Points are recovered on a Long Rest, which makes them very limited.

### Boss Point Default Uses

*   Choose to Succeed on a Save that you just failed.
*   Reduce the damage that you just took by half.
*   (possibly more to come)

### Boss Point Specific Creature Example Uses

*   When the monster would take Fire damage, it takes no damage, absorbs it, and regains HP equal to the Fire damage dealt. Additionally, it can increase the damage of its next Attack Check by an amount equal to the damage absorbed.
*   When Bloodied, the monster can spend 1 Boss Point for free at the start of its turn for 0 AP. It regains HP equal to its level or Prime Modifier (whichever is higher).
*   The monster recharges its Breath Weapon (or other large ability with a “recharge” component).
