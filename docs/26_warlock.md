## Warlock

Warlocks make a pact with a powerful entity that grants them magic. Their body and soul are a part of this contract and as such, they can tap into their own life force to enhance and amplify their magic and capabilities as well as drain the life force of other living creatures as well. They also choose a type of pact to be made giving even more benefits based on the pact chosen.

**Source of Power:** Warlocks gain their power through a pact with a powerful entity. By making a deal with this entity (and following the conditions), they gain access to magic that they can channel as their own. Unlike a Cleric (who believes in, follows, and has a true relationship with their deity), Warlocks simply make a deal and have more of a transactional or business relationship with their patron. Pacts can be made with all sorts of entities of all ranges of power levels as well, such as gods, devils, fey creatures, other worldly beings, dragons, and even other powerful Warlocks.

**Warlock Flavor:** A Warlock pact could be made by choice or by force, could be demanding or simple, and could be made with a good, neutral, or evil entity (which might be unknown by the Warlock). The Character might have to accomplish certain tasks in order to keep their powers, or the entity might take a more passive role and not ask much from them.

##### Beseech Patron (Flavor Feature)
During a Long Rest, while sleeping or meditating, you can access an Inner Sanctum within your mind. Its appearance is influenced by your psyche and is subject to change. While inside your Inner Sanctum, you can attempt to contact your Patron. 

If they choose to respond, they enter your mind and you might possibly be able to see or hear them. While connected to your Patron in this way, you are aware of your surroundings, but you can’t take actions or move. Your Patron chooses when to end the connection or you can make a Mental Save against your own Save DC to force the connection to end.

Things visually look different depending on your Patron, they could be in a foggy blackness, wreathed in flames, or emitting a blinding light. Your Patron has full control over your dream state and can shape the environment, create landscapes, objects, creatures, and images.

> **DC Tip:** This is a narrative driven feature where the GM can roleplay the Warlock’s Patron to grant information or even mechanical boons to the Character. GMs could choose to give out situational or temporary duration Advantage or Disadvantage, Spell effects like Bless / Bane, or even Inspiration depending on your conversation with your Patron.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Life Tap
You can attempt to cast a Spell without spending any MP. The Spell can include MP Enhancements, but the total MP you would normally spend can’t exceed your Mana Spend Limit. Compare the Spell Check you make to cast the Spell against the Life Tap DC. If the Spell doesn’t normally require a Spell Check, then you must make one to perform the Life Tap. 

**Life Tap DC:** Your Save DC + the amount of MP you would normally spend to cast the Spell. Your Life Tap DC increases by 5 after each attempt and the DC resets after a Long Rest.

**Life Tap Outcomes**

* **Success:** The Spell takes effect and you take True damage equal to the amount of MP you would normally spend.
* **Failure:** The Spell fails, has no effect.

Your Patron grants you the following benefits for bringing down their enemies:

* When you deal damage to a Bloodied creature, you can spend 1 Rest Point as a Reaction to regain 2 HP.
* When a creature drops to 0 HP or dies within 5 Spaces, you can spend 1 AP as a Reaction to regain 2 HP, provided the creature’s maximum HP is 5 or higher. You can only use this action once per creature per Combat.

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.
