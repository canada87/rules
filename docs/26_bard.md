## Bard

Bards utilize artistic expression through various forms to
connect with the emotions and heart of magic. This includes
a wide range of mediums such as musical instruments,
singing, dancing, drawing, painting, sculpting, poetry,
storytelling, inspirational speech, and more. They are great
at bringing the best out in those around them through both
helping and performing, showcasing high proficiency across
multiple disciplines. Bards are remarkably flexible and
adaptable spellcasters, capable of tapping into a wide array
of magical abilities with the appropriate artistic expression.

**Source of Power:** Bards derive their power from harnessing
their emotions and force of will, as well as those of others
around them. The feeling you get when listening to a
stirring song, hearing masterfully read poetry, or witnessing
a captivating performance that gives you chills, elevates
your heart rate, and provokes you to dance, that passion is
what fuels their potential. A Bard’s emotion, determination,
and willpower flows through their unique artistic expression,
touching the hearts and minds of those around them and
bringing their magic to life.

**Bard Flavor:** Bards compile a repertoire of artistic
expressions that they manifest as Spells. Musician Bards
utilize specific songs or instruments to cast Spells, while
dancer Bards perform particular dance moves that
represent different Spells. Storyteller Bards initiate combat
by narrating tales of wonder and adventure, seamlessly
weaving Spells into key points of the story. Painter Bards
fluidly and freely paint images, each triggering a specific Spell.

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Font of Inspiration
You are an ever present source of aid for your allies. You gain the following benefits:

* **Ranged Help Attack:** The range of your Help Action when aiding an Attack increases to 10 Spaces.
* **Help Reaction:** When a creature that you can see makes a Check, you can take the Help Action as a Reaction to aid them with their Check, provided you’re within range to do so.

> **DC Tip:** Helping with a Skill or Trade Check doesn’t have a default range limitation. The GM determines the range of the type of help required.

##### Remarkable Repertoire

You’ve picked up a few tricks along your travels, granting
you the following benefits:

**Jack of All Trades:** You gain 2 Skill Points.

**Magical Secrets:** You learn any 2 Spells of your choice from
any Spell List.

**Magical Expression:** You learn to express your art in a
unique manner, granting you the ability to alter how you
cast Spells. Choose the manner of your expression: Visual
or Auditory.

* **Visual:** Through acrobatics, dancing, juggling, painting,
drawing, or miming, you can ignore the Verbal
Components of a Spell you cast, but you must provide a
Somatic Component instead.
* **Auditory:** Through singing, playing music, poetry,
comedy, or storytelling, you can ignore the Somatic
Components of a Spell you cast, but you must provide a
Verbal Component instead.

##### Crowd Pleaser (Flavor Feature)

When you spend at least 5 minutes performing an Artistry
Trade for one or more people who are actively watching or
listening to your performance, you can make an Artistry
Trade Check Contested by the targets’ Charisma Save.
Success: You gain ADV on Charisma Checks against the
target for 1 hour or until you become hostile. Creatures have
ADV on the Save if they’re considered hostile toward you.

> **DC Tip:** If the performance is in front of a lot of people,
the GM might decide to roll for ALL “commoners” in one
single Save. For example, a group of commoners’ Charisma
Save would probably only be a +1 or so. If there were also
important NPCs within the crowd, then they could roll for
those individually.
