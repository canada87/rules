# Spellcasting

## Spellcasting Requirements

In order to cast a Spell, you must know the Spell, and spend the amount of Resources it requires (Action Points and Mana Points). The maximum number of Mana Points you can spend on a single Spell must be equal to or lower than your Mana Spend Limit (see below).

## Spells Known

Spellcaster Classes know a number of Spells as shown in the Spells Known column of their Class Tables. The number of Spells they know increases with level to reflect their growing knowledge of magic as they gain experience. When a PC learns a new Spell, the Spell must be included in their Spell List and possess any required Spell Tags. If a PC has access to multiple Spellcasting Features, they can learn new Spells by following the rules of either Feature.

> **Example:** A Wizard can learn any Spell from the Arcane Spell List, however Sorcerers get to choose 1 of the 3 Spell Lists to learn their Spells from. Alternatively, Warlocks can learn any Spell from any Spell List, but are restricted by only being able to choose from 4 Spell Schools.

Spellcasters increase their Spells Known as they gain levels or through certain Class Features, Subclass Features, Talents, or Ancestry Traits.

## Spell Lists

There are 3 Spell Lists: Arcane, Divine, and Primal. A Spell List represents the domains of magic accessible to a Spellcaster using a certain source of magic. The Arcane Spell List includes all manner of Spells that can be cast using Arcane magic. The same is true of other Spell Lists; the Divine Spell list includes Spells that can be cast using Divine Magic, and the Primal Spell list includes Spells that can be cast using Primal Magic.

### Arcane

Arcane magic draws power from unrefined, raw, chaotic magical sources. This type of magic is used by mortal beings, covers a wide variety of unique Spells, and can be cast using incantations, rituals, runes, and other forms of organization that transforms raw magic into structured forms. Wizards, Warlocks, and Bards are the primary practitioners of this type of magic.

### Divine

Divine magic draws power from divine beings, such as deities (greater and lesser gods), their followers (angels, archons, etc.), or the manifestations of abstract universal concepts (order, love, peace, war, etc.).

### Primal

Primal magic draws power from the physical embodiment of the universe (the land, air, rivers, and fires) and the natural creatures that abide within it (plants, animals, and nature spirits). Druids use Primal magic through their supernatural relationship with nature itself, while Shamans use powerful totems of nature to manifest aspects of its power (bear fortitude, bull strength, wolf smell, eagle sight, etc.).

## Gaining a Spell List

You can gain access to a Spell List through your Class's Spellcasting Feature (if it has one) or by selecting one from another Class using a Multiclassing Talent. When you learn a new Spell, you can select that Spell from any Spell List to which you currently have access.

> **Example:** If a Spellcasting Feature grants you access to the Arcane Spell List but only to Spells within the Necromancy Spell School, then you can only learn a Necromancy Spell from the Arcane Spell List, unless another Feature grants you access to the Arcane Spell list without that restriction on Spell choice.

## Spell Resources

Each Spell has a minimum number of Action Points (AP)
that must be spent to cast the Spell. Many Spells also
include a minimum number of Mana Points (MP) that must
also be spent to cast the Spell. This is known as the Base
Mana Cost of a Spell.

### Action Points

All Spells require you to spend AP to cast them, with 2
AP as the standard cost for most Spells. Some Spells cost
1 AP (such as Cantrips) and usually have a lower base
damage with modest effects. More powerful Spells have a
higher AP cost (3 AP or higher) and deal greater damage or
produce greater effects. These Spells may require a single
Spellcaster to spend multiple turns to cast, or multiple
Spellcasters working together (see “Combo Spellcasting”
on page 60 below).

### Mana Points

Each Spell has an MP cost that you must spend to cast it.
There are different ways to spend additional MP on Spells,
and the MP is spent when the Spell goes off successfully.

**Gaining Mana:** Your PC starts off by having 0 MP, but can
gain MP in a few ways:

* **Spellcaster Class Feature:** If you choose a Spellcaster
Class then you have a maximum number of MP equal
to the amount of MP in the Mana Points column of your
Spellcaster Class Table. You gain MP from this table from
levels 1-10 and then you gain MP from your Prestige
Path from levels 11-20.

* **Spellcaster Path:** If you spend a Path point on the
Spellcaster Path, you gain bonus MP equal to the amount
shown on the Mana Points column of the Spellcaster
Path Table.

You Regain all of your Mana Points when you
complete a Long Rest.

**Missing with Mana:** When you spend MP to cast a Spell
that deals damage, the target takes half damage on a Miss.

> **DC Tip:** See “Combat Resources” on page 39 for more
information on Action Points and Mana Points.

## Spellcasting without Mana Points

Certain Spells can be cast without spending MP. These Spells include special Spell Tags, such as the Cantrip and Ritual Spell Tags.

### Cantrips

Spells with the Cantrip Spell Tag don’t have an MP cost but can be empowered with MP to enhance their damage or effects.

### Rituals

By performing a 10 minute ritual immediately before casting a Spell with the Ritual Spell Tag, the Spell can be cast without spending MP even if it normally has an MP cost.

## Spell Enhancements

Spell Enhancements allow a Spellcaster to increase the potency of their Spells by spending additional MP on the Spell (or AP for Cantrips). Spell Enhancements are specific to each Spell and are included in a Spell’s description. Many Spell Enhancements increase a Spell’s damage, its duration, its range, its number of targets, or its Area of Effect.

**Performing a Spell Enhancement:** When you cast a Spell, you can spend additional AP or MP (stated in the Spell’s description) to perform a Spell Enhancement with your Spell. If the Spell requires a Spell Check, you must choose to do so before you make the Check. You can perform the same Spell Enhancement multiple times per Spell, unless it’s stated otherwise.

## Mana Spend Limit

You can only spend a maximum number of Mana Points equal to your Combat Mastery at one time. This limitation includes MP spent on Spell Enhancements and other Features that require MP. This is called your Mana Spend Limit.

> **Example:** A level 6 Sorcerer (Combat Mastery of 3) can spend up to 3 MP on any Spell they cast. They could cast a Spell with a base cost of 3 MP, or they could cast a Spell with a base cost of 2 MP and spend 1 MP on Spell Enhancements. Alternatively, they could cast a Spell with no MP cost, such as a Cantrip, and spend 3 MP on Spell Enhancements.

## MP Effects

These are abilities and effects (usually coming from Class
Features) that cost MP and are very similar to what types of
effects a Spell could cause. You can use an MP Effect (such
as the Bard’s Bardic Performance Feature) in place of a
Spell for the purposes of a Spell Duel or Combo Spellcasting.

## Casting a Spell

When you cast a Spell, you must make a Spell Check to
determine the Spell’s degree of success or failure. Your
Spell Check is compared against the target’s Defense, the
Spell’s DC, or the target’s Contested Check.

### Spell Check vs Defense

These Spell Checks are compared against the target’s
Defense to determine whether or not the Attack hits the
target. This type of Spell Check is called a Spell Attack.
The Spell’s description will state whether the Spell Check
is made against the target’s PD or AD (see Defense). If
the result of the Spell Check is equal to or greater than the
target’s Defense, then the Attack hits.

### Spell Check vs Spell DC

These Spell Checks are compared against the Spell’s own
DC. Some Spells have a Spell DC in order to fully cast the
Spell as intended. The Spell is still cast on a failure (except
for a Critical Failure) but at a reduced effect. Depending on
the Spell’s DC Success statements, exceeding the Spell DC
by 5 or more may yield additional benefits.

### Spell Check vs Save

These Spells impose an effect on its target (such as a
Condition). The Spell Check is Contested against the
target’s Save. If the result of the Spell Check is greater
than the target’s Save, the target becomes subjected to
the Spell’s effect. Depending on the Spell’s Save Failure
statements, failing the Save by 5 or more may impose
additional penalties on the target.

### Dynamic Attack Save

When a Spell you cast initiates a Dynamic Attack Save
against the target, you make a Spell Check against the
target’s Defense (as shown above) and the target makes a
Save against your Save DC. Your Spell Check determines
if the Spell deals damage to the target. The target’s Save
determines if they’re subjected to the effects of the Spell.

### Natural 1’s

When you make a Spell Check and get a Natural 1 on the
d20 the Spell does not go off and it fizzles. You still spend
the AP for the attempt, but you don’t spend any MP or
other resources. This Spell Check still counts as a Spell
Check towards the Multiple Check Penalty.

### Targeting Multiple Creatures

If a Spell you cast targets more than 1 creature, or includes
more than 1 in an Area of Effect (such as an Arc, Cone,
Cylinder, Line, or Sphere), then you make 1 Spell Check
against all creatures. Any Features you use to add extra
damage only affect 1 target of your choice (not all of them).

> **Example:** If a Wizard casts *Fireball* that covers an area that includes 4 creatures, the Wizard would make 1 Spell Check and compare it to the Physical Defense (PD) of each creature. If it’s Spell Check is equal to or higher than a target’s PD, it deals full damage against that target. If the Spell Check is lower than a target’s PD, it deals half damage instead.

### Structure of Spellcasting Mechanics (Sidebar)

When you cast a Spell, you'll always make a Spell Check. Your result will be contested by one of 3 values depending on what the Spell does and may force the target to make a Save.

*   **Only Damage:** Your Spell Check is contested by a target's PD or MD.
*   **Only Effect:** Your Spell Check is contested by a target's Check or Save.
*   **Damage & Effect:** Your Spell Check is contested by a target's PD or MD, and the target makes a Check or Save against your Save DC.

## Spell Characteristics

### Components

There are 3 types of Components that a Spell could have. Some Spells require all 3, while some only require 1. In order to cast any Spell you must satisfy its Components outlined below.

#### Verbal

These are the magical words and incantations needed to manifest the magical effects of a spell. This represents the PC uttering a few words to cast the Spell.

##### Downsides

*   Nearby creatures may hear you cast the Spell.
*   You can’t cast Spells with a Verbal Component if you’re silenced by magical or mundane means (*Silence* Spell or your mouth is gagged).
*   You lose your Breath when using a Verbal Component to cast a spell while underwater or when you otherwise need to hold your breath (see Breath).

> **DC Tip:** From a roleplay perspective, the PC could say a specific word, a phrase, a strange sound, or ignore this completely. It’s just important for both GM and Player to understand that the PC is making a sound of some kind when casting a Spell.

#### Somatic

These are the gestures, movements, and physical actions needed to control the magical energies within a Spell.

##### Downsides

*   Creatures that can see you may notice that you’re casting a Spell.
*   If your hands are bound or restrained from movement in any way, you can’t cast Spells with Somatic Components.
*   You need at least one free hand that’s not holding anything to satisfy the Somatic Component. Having a Shield strapped to one hand doesn’t count as a “free hand”.

> **DC Tip:** From a roleplay perspective, the PC could move their arms around in a grand display, use simple hand gestures, or ignore this completely. It’s just important for both GM and Player to understand that the PC is visibly moving their hand around when casting a Spell.

#### Material

These are objects, items, ingredients, and other physical items needed to cast the Spell. Most Spells don’t have Material Components required to cast them, but those that do usually either have a high gold cost or use an item that the GM can determine the rarity of.

**Consumed Materials:** These materials are consumed when you cast the Spell, being burnt away, disintegrating, or vanishing in some manner. Consumed Materials are gone after casting the Spell.

**Persistent Materials:** These materials aren’t consumed but are required to have on hand to cast the Spell.

##### Downsides

*   You can’t cast these Spells without having the Material Component.
*   If the Spell consumes the Material Component, then you must replace it before you can cast it again.
*   The required item could be very rare or have a high gold cost to obtain.

> **DC Tip:** From a roleplay perspective, the PC could weave in the Spell Components into their description of them casting a Spell. Players that want to add flavor to their spellcasting can create their own Material Components for a Spell (like slime from a frog to cast the *Grease* Spell). But these “flavor” Components should not be held against them by the GM unless the player wants to track how many Spell Components they have.

### Duration

Spells can either be Instantaneous or Continuous in their duration, and some Spells require you to Concentrate on them in order to keep them going.

#### Instantaneous

Instantaneous Spells take effect the moment a spellcaster finishes casting the Spell.

#### Continuous

These Spells last a specific amount of time. They can often end early when the affected creature succeeds on a following Save against the effect, the affected creature or another creature within 1 space performs an Action to end the effect, or some other condition mentioned by the effect, such as breaking line of sight, occurs.

**Repeated Saves:** Some Spell effects have a lingering effect to them that allows the target to repeat their Save at the end of their turns.

#### Sustain Action

Some effects require you to Sustain them or they end. You
must spend 1 AP at the start of each of your turns to Sustain
an effect until the start of your next turn. You can’t Sustain
an effect while Dazed. When you become Dazed, any
effect you’re Sustaining immediately ends.

**Outside of Combat:** You can only Sustain 1 effect at a time
outside of Combat. If you attempt to Sustain a 2nd effect
while already Sustaining a first, the first effect immediately
ends.

### Targets

Spells will declare a certain number of targets (one or multiple). The targets might have to be inside of the Spell’s Range or Area of Effect to be chosen as targets.

### Range

How far away a Spell can be cast on a target. If the Spell affects an area centered on a space, Range determines how far away the targeted space can be.

### Areas of Effect

The area that the Spell takes up. This is represented in a zone of some kind in one of the following patterns below:

#### Arc

An Arc forms half of a sphere. The Arc’s size is expressed as a radius in Spaces that extends in a 180° arc from the point of origin in a direction of your choice. An Arc's point of origin isn’t included in the Arc's area of effect.

#### Aura

An Aura extends from an object, creature, or location in a fixed distance in all directions, but not through Full Cover, and moves with it. Unless otherwise stated, the object, creature, or location is subjected to the Aura’s effect(s).

#### Cone

A Cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length. A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect.

#### Cube

You select a Cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side. A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect.

#### Cylinder

A Cylinder is expressed as a circle that extends vertically. A Cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a Cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the Cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the Cylinder.

A Cylinder's point of origin is included in the Cylinder's area of effect.

#### Line

A Line is 1 Space wide and 1 Space tall, unless stated otherwise, and extends a fixed distance in one direction from an object, creature, or location. A Line’s point of origin isn’t included in the Line's area of effect.

#### Sphere

You select a Sphere's point of origin, and the Sphere extends outward in all directions from that point. The Sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.

A Sphere's point of origin is included in the Sphere's area of effect.

#### Wall

A Wall is a series of 1 Space squares connected to each other with at least one face adjacent to the face of another square. The width and height of a Wall is assumed to be 1 Space unless otherwise stated. A length will always be given.

(More to come in future updates)

## Advanced Spellcasting

### Combo Spellcasting

If you and 1 or more creatures know the same Spell, you can join your resources together to cast the Spell as a team. This is called Combo Spellcasting.

> **DC Tip:** Remember that MP Effects (such as a Druid’s Nature’s Veil Feature) count as Spells for the purposes of Spell Duels and Combo Spellcasting.

#### Requirements

You must meet the following requirements to participate in a Combo Spell:

*   You know the Spell.
*   You have enough AP to cast the Spell.
*   You are within 5 Spaces of at least 1 other participant.
*   Each participant must share the same position in the Initiative Order (see “Simultaneous Initiative” on page 63).

> **DC Tip:** You can always delay your turn to act alongside an ally (see “Delayed Initiative” on page 63).

**Primary Caster:** Everyone participating in the Combo Spellcasting must agree on which of them will be the Primary Caster. They will act as the Spell’s Point of Origin.

**Contributing Mana:** Each participant can contribute an amount of MP between 1 and their Mana Spend Limit towards the casting of the Spell. The total mana spent must be equal to or higher than the base MP cost of the Spell. The total MP spent on the Spell has no limit as long as participants do not exceed their own Mana Spend Limits.

> **Example:** 2 creatures have a Mana Spend Limit of 4 each. By performing a Combo Spellcasting, they can combine their MP together, up to 4 MP each for a total of 8 MP spent to cast a Spell. By working together, they can produce a much more powerful version of a Spell they could normally cast individually.

**Highest Check & DC:** Every participant makes their Spell Check to cast the Spell. The highest Spell Check and the highest Save DC among them is used to determine the outcome.

### Stacking Magical Effects

A target can only be affected by a single magical effect of the
same name (a single creature can only be mind controlled
by 1 person). If there’s a magical effect on a creature and
you cast a Spell with the same effect, both casters must
perform a Contested Spell Check to determine which Spell
effect prevails over the target.

The Spellcaster who already has the effect on the creature
doesn’t have to spend any additional MP, they get to add a
bonus to their roll equal to the base MP of the Spell they cast.
