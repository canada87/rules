## Commander

Commanders are the leaders of the battlefield, inspiring their allies and leading them to victory. They can command their allies to attack or move around the battlefield, and can even “heal” allies by making them dig deep within themselves to push forward in combat.

**Source of Power:** Commanders utilize their extensive leadership skills and tactical battle knowledge. This could come from being a war veteran, inspiring leader, or a tactical mastermind.
