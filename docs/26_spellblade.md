## Spellblade

Spellblades combine their combat prowess with their ability to harness and channel magic into weapons. They can form a bond with a weapon to imbue it with damage, call it back to them, and more. Spellblades can learn a wide range of disciplines depending on their unique combination of martial and spellcasting prowess. They even gain the ability to cast spells through their weapons.

**Source of Power:** Spellblades are unique in that there are a variety of ways and sources for them to harness their power. They could draw this magic from a wide variety of sources. Here are just a few examples:

* Power bestowed by a patron, deity, or some powerful entity that takes an interest in them.
* An external or supernatural force that even they don’t fully understand.
* Their own bloodline or connections to the past.
* Their careful study and practice of both swords and spells.
* They take up their blade in honor of a deity, cause, or goal.
* They make an oath or vow to someone (or themselves) to stand for or against something.
* Power of their raw emotions, expressed through the use of artistic flourishes with their weapon.
* A strange weapon they found that bonded with them, prompting them on the path of the Spellblade.

### Spellblade Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Spellblade Stamina
You regain 1 SP when you Hit with a Spell Attack or succeed on a Spell Check, provided you don’t spend SP as part of that Action.

##### Bound Weapon
During a Quick Rest, you can magically bond with 1 Weapon and choose an Elemental or Mystical damage type, this becomes your “Bound Damage”. While you hold the Bound Weapon, it gains the following properties:

* **Illuminate:** You can spend 1 AP to cause it to emit Dim or Bright Light (you choose the light’s appearance) in a 5 Space radius. The light is extinguished if you release the Weapon or choose to do so for free.
* **Smite:** When you make a Martial Attack with the Weapon, you can spend 1 or more SP to deal +1 Bound Damage per SP spent (+2 damage per SP spent if it’s a Melee Attack).
* **Recall:** While the Weapon is within 20 Spaces, unheld, and unsecured, you can call your Weapon back to you for free, causing it to fly to you. If you don’t have a free hand when you call it, or you choose not to grab it, it falls in your Space at your feet.
* **Ending Early:** Your bond with the Weapon ends early if you use this Feature again or you choose to end it for free.

    * Your Maximum MP increases by 1.
    * You learn 1 additional Spell.
* **Warrior:** You gain the following benefits:
    * You gain Heavy Armor and Heavy Shield Mastery.
    * You learn 2 Maneuvers.
* **Acolyte:** You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to produce 1 of the following effects:
    * **Heal:** You gain a pool of healing that you can use to restore HP to any number of creatures within 5 Spaces of you, distributing the HP among them (minimum of 1 HP each). Make a DC 10 Spell Check. **Success:** You can restore up to 3 HP. **Success (each 5):** +1 HP. **Failure:** You only restore up to 2 HP.
    * **Cure:** You can attempt to remove 1 Poison or Disease from a creature of your choice within 1 Space of you. Make a Spell Check against the DC of the Poison or Disease. **Success:** The chosen Poison or Disease ends on the target.
* **Hex Warrior:** You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to Curse a creature within 5 Spaces for 1 minute. The target must make a Repeated Physical Save against your Save DC. **Failure:** It contracts 1 of the following Curses of your choice:
    * **Umbral Rot:** The target’s flesh begins to decay and peel, causing it to take 1 Umbral damage at the start of each of its turns.
    * **Black Blood:** The target’s blood turns black, preventing it from regaining HP. Creature’s without blood are immune to this effect.
    * **Sickening Fever:** The target contracts a deadly fever, causing it to become Dazed or Impaired (your choice).
* **Spell Breaker:** You can spend 2 AP to initiate a Spell Duel against a Spell Attack using a Weapon instead of casting a Spell, provided the target of the Spell is within the range of your Weapon. When you do, you make an Attack Check and you can spend SP and MP (for a total up to your Mana Spend Limit) to gain a bonus on your Check equal to the SP and MP spent. You have ADV on your Check if you’re within 1 Space of the caster.
* **Spell Warder:** When you deal Elemental or Mystical damage with an Attack, you gain Resistance (1) to that damage type until the start of your next turn. If you deal Elemental or Mystical damage again while this is already active, you can choose to keep the current Resistance or switch it out for the new one instead.
* **Blink Blade:** Once per turn, when you make an Attack, you can choose to teleport to a Space you can see within 1 Space immediately before or after making the Attack (your choice).

##### Sense Magic (Flavor Feature)
You can spend 1 minute focusing your mind to detect the following creatures within 20 Spaces: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead. Make a Spell Check against each creature’s Mental Save. 

* **Check Success:** You learn the target’s creature type and know its location until the end of your next turn. 
* **Check Failure:** You learn nothing and can’t use this Feature against the target again until you complete a Long Rest.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Spellstrike
Once per Long Rest when you cast a Spell that only targets one creature, you can choose to deliver the Spell through a Weapon. The Spell's range changes to that of your Weapon’s (up to the range of the Spell) and you can add Spell Enhancements, perform Maneuvers, or both. When you do, the target makes 1 Physical Save for all Physical Save effects and 1 Mental Save for all Mental Save effects if there are any you cause.

Make a Spell Check against the target’s PD. If the Spell forces the target to make a Save, it does so against your Save DC.

* **Hit:** The target suffers the damage of the Weapon plus the Spell's damage (if any). 
* **Save Failure:** The target suffers the effects (if any).

You regain the use of this Feature when you roll for Initiative.

> **Example:** A Spellblade casts the Firebolt Spell and chooses to use a Short Sword (Melee Weapon) to deliver the Spell. The Spell's range becomes Melee (1 Space) to match the Short Sword. The Attack deals the Short Sword’s damage (1) plus the Firebolt’s damage (2) on a Hit (total of 3 damage). If the Spellblade added the Burning Spell Enhancement to the Firebolt, the target would need to make a Physical Save (as part of a Dynamic Attack Save) to resist the Burning Condition.

##### Might & Magic
You’ve learned how to focus your magical and martial prowess into a unified power, granting you the following benefits:

* When you cast a Spell you can spend SP in place of AP for AP Enhancements.
* You can spend MP in place of SP but you can’t use more MP than your Maximum SP (total SP and MP spent cant exceed your SP Maximum).
* Once per turn, you can spend 1 MP to regain 2 SP.

> **DC Tip:** Attack cantrips such as Firebolt have AP Enhancements. 

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.
