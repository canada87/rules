## Cleric

Clerics can reach out and call upon the power of a deity to aid them in battle and to support them and their allies. Clerics can range from a knowledgeable priest to a knight in holy armor. They reach out to their deity to empower their magic in ways mortals normally cannot.

**Source of Power:** Clerics have a relationship with a powerful deity, or deities, that they’re in service to. Through their faith, they’re granted magical power by their deity. They could serve a good god of life that grants them healing magic or an evil god of death that grants them abilities to end life.

### Cleric Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Cleric Order
Your religious teachings grant you an affinity to a type of Divine Damage and a Sacred Role.

* **Divine Damage:** Choose a Divine Damage type: Radiant or Umbral. When you make a Spell Attack with a Divine Spell, you can choose to change its damage to the chosen Divine Damage type.
* **Sacred Role:** Choose a Sacred Role: Priest, Scribe, or Templar.
    * **Priest.** When you spend MP to cast a Spell that restores HP to at least 1 creature, you can restore 1 HP to a creature within 1 Space of you (including yourself) that wasn’t healed by the spell.
    * **Scribe.** You learn 1 additional Spell and gain 2 Skill Points that can only be spent on Intelligence Skills.
    * **Templar.** You gain Mastery with Heavy Shields and Heavy Armor.

##### Divine Blessing
You can spend 1 AP to say a prayer and petition your deity for their divine blessing. Choose 1 of the blessings listed below. Each blessing has a listed MP cost that you must spend to gain the blessing. Once during the next minute, you can apply the blessing to a Spell you cast. If your Spell targets more than 1 creature, the blessing only applies to 1 target of your choice.

* **Destruction:** (1 MP) The target takes 3 Divine damage, provided that the result of your Spell Check is equal to or higher than the target’s MD. If the Spell doesn’t normally require a Spell Check, then you must make one when you apply this blessing.
* **Guidance:** (1 MP) The target gains a d8 Help Die that they can add to 1 Check of their choice they make within the next minute.
* **Restoration:** (1 MP) The target regains 3 HP.
* **Unused Blessing:** You can only have 1 blessing at a time. If you petition your deity for a blessing while you already have a blessing, the first blessing immediately ends without granting any benefit. If the blessing ends without granting any benefit, you regain the MP spent to gain the blessing.

##### Divine Omen (Flavor Feature)
Once per Long Rest, you can spend 10 minutes to commune with your Deity.

* **Question:** You can ask them 1 question, which must be posed in a way that could be answered with a yes or no.
* **Response:** The deity responds to the best of their knowledge and intentions in one of the following responses: Yes, No, or Unclear. 
A response of Unclear could come from the deity not knowing the answer, wanting to purposefully keep it a secret, the question being phrased in a confusing or complicated way, or maybe there isn't an answer to that question (it's complicated).

> **Example:** The response could be audible (a formless voice), visual (words in the sky or on appear on a book), symbolic (images and shapes telling a story). The answer could be delivered by a creature (random animal or human becomes possessed and starts talking), a formless voice (talking flames), within your own mind (a dream or vision), or any other means they want. 

> **DC Tip:** Regardless of how the answer is given, it should be clear to the PLAYER what the answer was.

* **Casting this Spell Again:** If you cast the Spell more than once per Long Rest, you must make a DC 15 Spell Check. **Failure:** You receive no answer. Each time you cast this Spell again before you complete a Long Rest, the DC increases by 5.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Divine Intervention
Once per Long Rest, you can spend 3 AP to call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great to replenish you and your allies. Make a DC 10 Spell Check. 

* **Success:** You gain a pool of healing equal to twice your Prime Modifier that you can use to restore HP to any number of creatures within 5 Spaces, distributing the HP among them. Additionally, you regain an amount of MP equal to your Prime Modifier.
* **Failure:** Your pool of healing is equal to your Prime Modifier and you only regain 1 MP.

##### Channel Divinity
You gain the ability to channel the direct power of your deity once per Short Rest. When you use this Feature, choose 1 of the following options:

* **Censure Undead:** You can spend 2 AP to censure all Undead creatures who can see or hear you within 5 Spaces. Make a Spell Check contested by each target’s Repeated Mental Save. **Save Failure:** The target is Stunned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
* **Censure Divine:** You can spend 2 AP to censure all Celestials and Fiends of your choice who can see or hear you within 5 Spaces. Make a Spell Check against each target’s MD, and each target makes Repeated Mental Save against your Save DC. **Attack Hit:** The target takes 3 Divine Damage. **Save Failure:** The target becomes Intimidated of you for 1 minute or until it takes damage.
