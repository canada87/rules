# Conditions

## Condition Immunity

When you have Immunity to a Condition, you completely ignore its effects.

## Conditions List

### Bleeding

You take 1 True damage at the start of each of your turns.

**Ending Bleeding**

* **Healed:** You’re subjected to an effect that restores your HP.
* **Medicine Action:** A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC 10 Medicine Check on itself or another creature within 1 Space. 
    * **Success:** Removes the Bleeding Condition. 
    * **Success (each 5):** The creature gains +1 Temp HP.

### Blinded

You automatically fail Checks that require Sight and all other creatures are considered Unseen. You are Exposed (Attacks against you have ADV) and Hindered (You have DisADV on Attacks). Additionally, while you’re not guided by another creature, all terrain is Difficult Terrain to you (moving 1 Space costs 2 Spaces).

### Burning

You take 1 Fire damage at the start of each of your turns. You or another creature within 1 Space can spend 1 AP to put it out.

### Charmed

Your Charmer has ADV on Charisma Checks made against you. Additionally, you can’t target your Charmer with harmful Attacks, abilities, or magic effects.

### Dazed

You have DisADV on Mental Checks.

**Heavily Dazed:** You also have DisADV on Mental Saves.

### Deafened

You automatically fail Checks that require Hearing, and all creatures are considered Unheard by you. Additionally, you have Resistance to Sonic damage.

### Doomed X

The HP threshold of Death’s Door for determining death is decreased by an amount equal to the value of X. If your Doomed value is ever equal to or higher than your Death's Door threshold, you instantly die upon reaching 0 HP. You lose all stacks of Doomed when you complete a Long Rest.

> **Example:** If your Death’s Door threshold is -3 and you have Doomed 1, the HP threshold of Death’s Door changes from -3 HP to -2 HP, causing you to die if your HP is ever reduced to -2 HP or lower.

### Exhaustion X

You gain a penalty equal to X on all Checks and Saves you make. Additionally your Speed and Save DC is reduced by X as well. If a creature ever reaches Exhaustion 6, they immediately die.

> **Example:** If you have Exhaustion 3, you would have a -3 penalty on Checks and Saves, your Speed would be reduced by 3 Spaces, and your Save DC would be reduced by 3.

### Exposed

Attacks against you have ADV.

### Frightened

You must spend your turns trying to move as far away as you can from the source of the effect as possible. The only Action you can take is the Move Action to try to run away, or the Dodge Action if you’re prevented from moving or there’s nowhere farther to move. You’re also considered Rattled (you can’t move closer to the source) and Intimidated (DisADV on all Checks while it’s within your line of sight).

### Grappled

Your Speed becomes 0 and you have DisADV on Agility Saves.

**Ending a Grapple**

* **Escape Grapple:** You can spend 1 AP to attempt to free yourself from a Grapple. Make a Martial Check contested by the Grappler’s Athletics Check. 
    * **Success:** The Grapple immediately ends.
* **Incapacitated Grappler:** If the Grappler becomes Incapacitated, the Grapple immediately ends.
* **Forced Movement:** If an effect attempts to forcibly move you beyond the Grappler’s reach, the Grappler makes the Check or Save instead of you. If the effect targets both you and the Grappler, the Grappler makes 1 Check or Save for both of you. 
    * **Success:** The targets of the effect aren’t moved.
    * **Failure:** The Grapple immediately ends, and the targets of the effect are moved.
* **Falling:** If you begin falling while Grappled, and your Grappler isn't falling with you, your Grappler holds you in the air if they can carry your weight.

### Incapacitated

You can’t Speak, Concentrate, or spend Action Points.

### Invisible

You’re Unseen, making creatures that can’t see you Exposed (your Attacks against them have ADV) and Hindered against you (they have DisADV on Attacks against you).

### Petrified

You and your mundane belongings are turned into stone and you’re no longer aware of your surroundings. You become 10 times heavier and have Resistance (Half) to all damage.

You’re also Paralyzed (Attacks that Hit you are considered Critical Hits if the Attacker is within 1 Space of you), Stunned (automatically fail Agility, Might, and Physical Saves), Exposed (Attacks against you have ADV), and Incapacitated (you can’t Speak, Concentrate, or spend Action Points).

### Poisoned

You’re Impaired (DisADV on Physical Checks) and take 1 Poison damage at the start of each of your turns. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a Medicine Check (against the DC of the Poison) on itself or another creature within 1 Space. 
* **Success:** Removes the Poisoned Condition.

### Prone

While Prone, you’re subjected to the following effects:
* You’re Hindered (You have DisADV on Attacks).
* Ranged Attacks are Hindered against you.
* You’re Exposed (Attacks against you have ADV) against Melee Attacks.

**Crawling:** Your only movement option is to Crawl, which counts as Slowed 1 (Every 1 Space you move costs an extra 1 Space of movement).

**Standing Up:** You can spend 2 Spaces of movement to stand up, ending the Prone Condition on yourself. Standing up from Prone provokes Opportunity Attacks.

### Rattled

You can’t willingly move closer to your source of fear, and you’re Intimidated (DisADV on all Checks while it’s within your line of sight).

### Restrained

You’re Hindered (you have DisADV on Attacks), Exposed (Attacks against you have ADV), and Grappled (your Speed is reduced to 0 and you have DisADV on Agility Saves).

### Unconscious

You’re no longer aware of your surroundings, you drop whatever you’re holding, and you fall Prone. You’re also Paralyzed (Attacks made from within 1 Space that Hit you are considered Critical Hits), Stunned (automatically fail Agility, Might, and Physical Saves), Exposed (Attacks against you have ADV), and Incapacitated (you can’t Speak, Concentrate, or spend Action Points).

## Condition Stacking

Certain Conditions can stack multiple times, increasing the potency of the Condition’s effects on the target.

### Condition X Values

The Conditions with an X value in its name are examples of Conditions that apply a bonus or penalty to the target equal to the X value. If multiple unique effects impose the same Condition X, the X of those effects are added together.

> **Example:** For the Exhausted X Condition, if you had Exhausted 2, you’d subtract 2 from all d20 rolls made. If you had Exhausted 3, you’d subtract 3, and so on. 

### Stacking Conditions

A target can be affected by each of the following Conditions multiple times, with the effects of the same Condition stacking on the target in unique ways.

**Durations:** When a creature is subjected to the same Condition multiple times but with different durations, it’s important to keep track of the source of each Condition so you know when each Condition ends.

> **Example:** You might be Exposed against the next Attack against you, Exposed until the end of your next turn, and Exposed for 1 minute, all at the same time. These effects stack, but you need to track them independently to make sure you know how “Exposed” you currently are.

**Exposed**

A creature can be Exposed multiple times. They have stacking ADV equal to the number of sources of Exposed it’s subjected to.

> **Example:** If you were Exposed and another effect imposed the Condition on you again, you would become Exposed twice (Exposed 2), causing Attacks against you to have ADV 2 (roll 3 d20s and take the highest).

**Hindered, Impaired, & Dazed**

A creature can be Hindered, Impaired, or Dazed multiple times. They have stacking DisADV equal to the number of sources of each Condition it’s subjected to.

> **Example:** If you are Restrained (which causes you to be Hindered), and then fall Prone (also causing you to be Hindered), you now would have 2 stacks of Hindered (Hindered 2) and roll at DisADV 2 on all Attacks.

**Slowed**

A creature can be Slowed multiple times. They have a stacking penalty to their Speed equal to the number of sources of Slowed it’s subjected to.

> **Example:** A creature with Slowed must spend 2 Spaces (1 +1 extra) of movement to move every 1 Space. Alternatively, a creature with two stacks of Slowed (Slowed 2) requires spending 3 Spaces (1 +2 extra) to move 1 Space.

### Overlapping Conditions

A target can be affected by each of the following Conditions multiple times, but the effects of the same Condition don’t stack on the target.

**Charmed**

A creature can be Charmed by more than 1 creature at a time, each of them gaining ADV on Charisma Checks against the target. However, a creature that Charms a target more than once only gains the effects of the Charmed Condition once.

> **Example:** A creature doesn’t have ADV 2 on Charisma Checks against a target they’ve Charmed twice. They only have ADV 1 on Charisma Checks against the target.

**Frightened**

A creature can be Frightened by more than 1 creature at a time. If a creature is surrounded by multiple sources of their fear, they’re unable to move and can only take the Dodge Action.

> **DC Tip:** You could handle this like the Rattled DC Tip and they would not move and be forced to take the Dodge Action. You could also have them make a Fate Roll and have the dice decide which target they must run from, allowing them to run in the direction of another source of their fear.

**Grappled**

A creature that’s Grappled by more than 1 creature only suffers the effects of the Grappled Condition once. However, a creature Grappled by multiple sources will remain Grappled until they’re free from being Grappled by all sources.

> **Example:** A creature doesn’t have DisADV 2 on Agility Saves as a result of being Grappled by 2 creatures. They only have DisADV on Agility Saves. 

**Moving a Multiple Grappled Target:** If multiple creatures are Grappling the same target and one of them tries to move the Grappled target, it must make a Contested Athletics Check against all creatures Grappling the same target. 
* **Success:** It ends the Grapple on the target by all creatures other than itself, allowing it to move the creature as normal. 

**Intimidated**

A creature can be Intimidated by more than 1 creature at a time, suffering DisADV on Checks while any source of their intimidation is within its sight. However, an Intimidated creature only suffers the effects of the Intimidated Condition once.

> **Example:** A creature doesn’t have DisADV 2 on Checks while 2 sources of intimidation are in sight. They only have DisADV 1 on Checks, regardless of the number of intimidation sources in sight.

**Rattled**

A creature can be Rattled by more than 1 creature at a time. If a creature is surrounded by multiple sources of their fear, they’re unable to move.

> **DC Tip:** A good example of being surrounded would be a creature flanked on 4 sides. The GM determines if a creature is surrounded or not.

**Restrained**

A creature that’s Restrained by more than 1 creature only suffers the effects of the Restrained Condition once. However, a creature Restrained by multiple sources will remain Restrained until they are free from being Restrained by all sources.

**Taunted**

A creature can only be Taunted by 1 creature at a time. If they’re Taunted again by another creature, the first Taunt immediately ends.

> **Example:** If a Goblin is Taunted by a Ranger, then later becomes Taunted by a Fighter, the Goblin is no longer Taunted by the Ranger. 

### Non-Stacking Conditions

The following Conditions don’t stack in any way: Burning, Bleeding, Poisoned, Deafened, Blinded, Invisible, Prone, Incapacitated, Stunned, Paralyzed, Unconscious, Petrified, and Surprised.
