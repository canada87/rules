# Saves

Many Saves in DC20 target one of a creature’s 4 Attribute Saves (Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence).

## Attribute Saves

When a creature is subjected to an effect, they make an Attribute Save to determine whether or not they’re able to resist the effect. The Attribute used to make the Save is determined by the effect (or the GM).

### Making an Attribute Save
The creature rolls a d20, adds its given Attribute, and adds its Combat Mastery if it has Combat Mastery with the Attribute Save. If the result of the Attribute Save is equal to or higher than the Contested Check, the Attribute Save is successful.

**Attribute Save Formula:**

```
D20 + Attribute + Combat Mastery
```

> **Example (Might Save):** A level 2 Barbarian that attempts to resist being pushed against their will would make a Might Save to prevent themselves from moving. If their Might is 3 then they would roll a d20 and add 3 to their Might Save. If they also have Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) with Might Saves, then they would add +1 to their Save.

> **Example (Agility Save):** A level 5 Rogue that attempts to jump to safety when the ground beneath their feet collapses would make an Agility Save to secure its footing on solid ground. If their Agility is 4 then they would roll a d20 and add 4 to their Agility Save. If they also have Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) with Agility Saves, then they would add +3 to their Save.

> **Example (Charisma Save):** A level 10 Bard that attempts to resist being mind-controlled would make a Charisma Save to retain control over their own actions. If their Charisma is 5 then they would roll a d20 and add 5 to their Charisma Save. If they also have Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) with Charisma Saves, then they would add +5 to their Save.

> **Example (Intelligence Save):** A level 16 Wizard that attempts to break free of illusions that grip their senses would make an Intelligence Save to discern what’s real and what isn’t. If their Intelligence is 6 then they would roll a d20 and add 6 to their Intelligence Save. If they also have Combat Mastery (1/2 level, rounded up) with Intelligence Saves, then they would add +8 to their Save.

## Special Saves

### Death Saves
When a creature makes a Death Save, it rolls a d20. If the
result is 10 or higher it succeeds on its Death Save. See
“Death’s Door” on page 33 for more information on
Death Saves.

### Save Categories
Some Saves are organized into categories, such as Physical Saves, Mental Saves, and Death Saves.

#### Physical Saves: 
When an effect targets your overall physical abilities, you make a Physical Save. Your Physical Save bonus is equal to your Might Save bonus or Agility Save bonus, whichever is higher.

> **Example:**  A creature that attempts to resist gaining Exhaustion from a Spell that withers its body would make a Physical Save to avoid suffering any effects.

#### Mental Saves: 
When an effect targets your overall mental abilities, you make a Mental Save. Your Mental Save bonus is equal to your Charisma Save bonus or Intelligence Save bonus, whichever is higher.

> **Example:** A creature that attempts to resist being teleported against its will would make a Mental Save to remain in the same location. 

### Save DC 
Your Save DC represents the difficulty of a creature to resist your static effects (such as Traps) and ongoing effects (such as Spells). Every creature has a Save DC, which is equal to 10 + its Prime Modifier + its Combat Mastery.

**Save DC Formula:**
```
10 + Prime Modifier + Combat Mastery
```

**Repeated Saves:** When a creature fails a Save against an
effect that has the Repeated Save statement, it can repeat
its Save at the end of each of its turns. When that happens,
the creature repeats its Save against a Save DC (instead of
the original opposing Check).

> **Example:** A Giant Snake targets a Barbarian with a Melee Attack that causes the target to become Restrained. The Giant Snake makes an Attack Check that’s Contested by the Barbarian’s Physical Save. If the Barbarian fails its Save against the effect it becomes Restrained. However, the Barbarian can repeat its Save at the end of each of its turns to free itself from being Restrained. When it repeats its Save, it does so against the Giant Snake’s Save DC.

### Dynamic Attack Saves

Some game features (such as a Maneuvers, Techniques,
Spells, etc.) both deal damage and impose an effect on its
target. This triggers what is called a Dynamic Attack Save.
The provoking creature makes an Attack Check (or Spell
Check) at the same time that the target makes its Save.

The provoking creature’s Check is compared against the target’s
Defense to determine if the target takes damage, and the
target’s Save is compared against the provoking creature’s
Save DC to determine if the target is subjected to the effect.

#### Dynamic Attack Save Outcomes
A Dynamic Attack Save can result in 1 of 4 outcomes:

* **Attack Hit & Save Failure:** The target takes damage and is subjected to the effect.
* **Attack Miss & Save Failure:** The target does not take damage but is subjected to the effect.
* **Attack Hit & Save Success:** The target takes damage but is not subjected to the effect.
* **Attack Miss & Save Success:** The target does not take damage and is not subjected to the effect.

> **DC Tip:** There are many game features that both deal damage and impose an effect on its target. When this happens, an Attack Check or Spell Check is ALWAYS made to determine DAMAGE… while a Save is ALWAYS made against the EFFECT. This opens up many very interesting interactions on what the outcome will be and keeps things moving quickly because both the Attacker and the Target make these rolls at the same time (similar to how Contested Checks work). With Dynamic Attack Saves, you don’t have to wait for the Attack Check to hit, then have the target make a Save; they both happen at the same time.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

When a creature has Advantage (ADV) on a Check or Save, it rolls two d20 and takes the highest number rolled across both dice. If the creature has Disadvantage (DisADV) instead, it takes the lowest number across both dice.

> **Example:** A creature has ADV on a Check. Normally it would roll a single d20 when making the Check, but because it has ADV it rolls two d20 instead and takes the highest number rolled.

### Gaining Advantage
When a creature makes a Check or Save, it can spend 1 or more AP to gain ADV on its Check or Save per AP spent (see “Attack Checks” on page 24).

> **Example:** A Barbarian chooses to make an Attack with a Greatmaul against a creature. The Barbarian can spend 1 AP to grant themselves ADV on their Attack Check.

### Stacking ADV or DisADV
Sometimes a creature might have multiple sources of ADV or DisADV on a single Check or Save.

#### ADV X:
If a creature has multiple instances of ADV on a Check or Save, it has ADV X, where X represents the number of additional dice the creature rolls when making the Check or Save. The creature rolls 1 additional d20 for each ADV it has on the Check or Save, and takes the highest number across all dice. 

> **Example:** A creature has ADV 2 on a Check. It rolls a d20 plus 2 additional d20s (3 total dice) and takes the highest number rolled across all of the dice.

#### DisADV X:
If a creature has multiple instances of DisADV on a Check or Save, it has DisADV X, where X represents the number of additional dice the creature rolls when making the Check or Save. The creature rolls 1 additional d20 for each DisADV it has on the Check or Save, and takes the lowest number across all dice.

> **Example:** A creature has DisADV 3 on a Check. It rolls a d20 plus 3 additional d20s (4 total dice) and takes the lowest number rolled across all of the dice.

**DC Tip:** ADV 1 and DIsADV 1 is the same thing as “regular” ADV and DisADV. When rolling a d20 to make a Check or Save, the 1 just represents the 1 additional d20 you are rolling, which is what happens with regular ADV and DisADV. Most of the time they’ll be referred to as ADV and DisADV.

### Combining ADV & DisADV
If a creature has both ADV and DisADV at the same time, each instance cancels out. If they all cancel out, you’ll make a standard d20 roll as usual. If there are any remaining ADV or DisADV, then you make your roll with whatever ADV or DisADV is left over.

**Example 1:** If a creature had both ADV and DisADV then that would become a standard roll of a single d20. If you had DisADV 3 and also had ADV, then one of the ADV would cancel out one of the DisADV and you would be left with DisADV 2.

**Example 2:** If a creature has both DisADV 3 and and ADV 2 on a Check, two of the ADV cancel out two of the DisADV, leaving only one DisADV remaining. The Check is then made with DisADV 1, which is just regular DisADV (rolling 2 dice and taking the lower number).

**DC Tip:** Basically just subtract any ADV or DisADV from each other and see what you’re left with. If the answer is ever 0, then you just make a standard d20 roll.

### Variable ADV & DisADV
Gaining ADV and DisADV on Checks made against other creatures is very common. Sometimes you might have to make a Check against a group of creatures where you have ADV or DisADV on the Check against some of the targets but not all of them. When that happens, follow these steps below:

1. Make a Check against all targets you don’t have ADV or DisADV against by rolling a single d20 and adding any relevant bonuses you have on the Check against the targets.
2. For any additional targets you have ADV or DisADV against, roll a second d20 and compare it to the first d20 you already rolled. For all targets you have ADV against, choose the higher number rolled, and for DisADV choose the lower number rolled.
3. (Optional) If you have ADV/DisADV 2 or higher against any additional targets, repeat Step 2 for each additional dice you have to roll until you resolve the outcome of your Check against all targets.

> **Example:** A Wizard targets 3 creatures with a Fireball Spell. It doesn’t have ADV against the first target (rolls 1d20), has ADV against the second target (rolls 2d20), and ADV 2 against the third target (rolls 3d20). The Wizard rolls a d20 and uses it to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the first target. It then rolls another d20 and compares it to the first d20 (total of 2d20s) to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the second target. It then rolls another d20 and compares it to the first 2 d20s (total of 3d20s) to determine the outcome of its Spell Check against the third target.

### Multiple Check Penalty
During Combat, each time a creature makes the same Check before the end of its turn, they suffer stacking DisADV on that type of Check, such as specific Flat Attribute Checks (Flat Might, Flat Agility, Flat Charisma, Flat Intelligence), Attack Checks, Spell Checks, and specific Skill Checks (Stealth, Athletics, Influence, etc.), and specific Trade Checks (Theatre, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking, etc.). This penalty only applies to Checks made during the creature’s turn, and doesn’t apply to Reactions taken on another creature's turn (unless otherwise stated).

* 1st Attempt: Normal roll.
* 2nd Attempt: DisADV 1 (roll 2 dice and take the lowest result).
* 3rd Attempt: DisADV 2 (roll 3 dice and take the lowest result).
* 4th Attempt: DisADV 3 (roll 4 dice and take the lowest result).

> **Example:** If a creature casts a Spell by making a Spell Check, its first attempt would be a normal roll, but subsequent Spells would have stacking DisADV (as shown above).

> **DC Tip:** The Multiple Check Penalty does not apply outside of Combat. See Combat Resources for more information on how Actions are taken outside of Combat.

**Multiple Action Penalties:** Some Actions have penalties when you take it multiple times, such as the Help Action. These penalties count as the Multiple Check Penalty for the purposes of game mechanics that apply to Multiple Check Penalties.

## Check & Save Outcomes

### Critical Success & Failure

When a creature rolls a 20 on a d20, the Check or Save gains a Critical Success. Moreover, when a creature rolls a 1 on a d20, the Check or Save suffers a Critical Failure. A Critical Success or Critical Failure can affect the outcome in different ways, as determined by the type of Check or Save being made.

### Attack Checks & Spell Checks

#### Critical Success

##### Attack & Spell Checks:
When a creature gains a Critical Success on an Attack Check or Spell Check that deals damage, the attack is considered a Critical Hit (automatically hits and deals +2 damage). If it's an Attack Check or Spell Check that doesn’t deal damage, the Check automatically succeeds even if the result would normally fail. 

#### Critical Failure

##### Attack Checks:
When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on an Attack Check that deals damage, the attack automatically misses even if the result would normally hit. If it’s an Attack Check that doesn’t deal damage, the Check automatically fails even if the result would normally succeed.

##### Spell Checks:
When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on a Spell Check to cast a Spell or other similar effect, it fails to cast. When the Critical Failure happens, the AP and MP spent is lost, but any other resources (such as Arcane Points or material components) are not spent.

##### Attack & Spell Checks:
A creature that suffers a Critical Failure on an Attack Check or Spell Check becomes Exposed (Attack Checks made against it has ADV) against the next Attack made against it before the start of its next turn. 

> **DC Tip:** For Critical Failures, the GM could change the Condition to Hindered (your next Attack Check has DisADV) instead of Exposed, at their discretion.

## Saves, Skill Checks, & Trade Checks

### Critical Success
When a creature gains a Critical Success on a Save, Skill Check, or Trade Check, the Check or Save automatically succeeds even if the result would normally fail.

### Critical Failure
When a creature suffers a Critical Failure on a Save, Skill Check, or Trade Check, the Check or Save automatically fails even if the result would normally succeed.

> **DC Tip:** The GM should avoid asking PCs to make Checks where success shouldn’t be possible. If a PC ties a heavy chain around a building, it shouldn’t be possible for them to succeed on a Might Check to drag the building. Conversely, the GM should avoid asking PCs to make Checks where failure shouldn’t be possible, like asking a PC to make a Might Check pick up a pebble. Unless the circumstances introduce the possibility of success or failure, try to refrain from asking for Checks for activities that are impossible to succeed or fail at. Mistakes are going to happen and GMs might ask for a roll when they shouldn’t have. The final outcome of a Critical Success or Critical Failure are up to the GM, and players should respect that.

### Contested Critical Outcomes
When multiple creatures gain a Critical Success in a contest (or all creatures suffer a Critical Failure), the creature with the highest total result wins the contest.

## Degrees of Success & Failure

### Degrees of Success
If a creature succeeds on a Check or Save by 5 or more, they may gain additional benefits beyond those of a normal success. The Check or Save will include a success statement, such as Success, Success (5), Success (10), or Success (each 5).

#### Success
If the success statement says Success, the creature gains the listed benefits if the result of its Check or Save is equal to or higher than the opposing DC, Check, or Save.

#### Success (each 5)
If a success statement says Success (each 5), the creature gains the listed benefits for every 5 the result of its Check or Save is above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Unless stated otherwise, the creature can gain the additional benefits multiple times.

> **Example:** A Spell pushes a target back 3 Spaces on a successful Spell Check, but also includes the following success statement: “Success (each 5): +1 Space”. That means that each 5 points the Spell Check’s result is above the opposing DC, Check, or Save, the target is pushed 1 additional Space.

#### Success (5) & Success (10)
If a success statement says Success (5), the creature gains the listed benefits when they succeed by 5 or more above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Moreover, if the success statement says Success (10), they also gain the listed benefits when they succeed by 10 or more above the opposing DC, Check, or Save. This can continue on to Success (15) and further.

> **Example:** A Spell increases a creature’s Speed by 1 on a successful Spell Check, but has the following success statements: “Success (5): Ignore Difficult Terrain,” and “Success (10): Immune to Slowed.” That means that the creature’s Speed is increased by 1 and ignores Difficult Terrain if its Spell Check is 5 above the Spell’s DC, and the creature is also immune to the Slowed Condition if its Spell Check is 10 above the Spell’s DC.

### Degrees of Failure
If a creature fails on a Check or Save by 5 or more, they may suffer additional penalties beyond those of a normal failure. The Check or Save will include a failure statement, such as Failure, Failure (5), Failure (10), or Failure (each 5).

#### Failure
If a failure statement says Failure, the creature suffers the listed penalties if the result of its Check or Save is below the opposing DC, Check, or Save.

#### Failure (each 5)
If a failure statement says Failure (each 5), the creature suffers the listed penalties for every 5 the result of its Check or Save is below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Unless stated otherwise, the creature can suffer the additional penalties multiple times.

> **Example:** A trap deals 4 Fire damage to a target on a failed Save, but also includes the following failure statement: “Failure (each 5): +1 damage”. That means that each 5 points the Save is below the Trap’s Save DC, the target takes an additional +1 Fire damage.

#### Failure (5) & Failure (10)
If a failure statement says Failure (5), the creature suffers the listed penalties when they fail by 5 or more below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. Moreover, if the failure statement says Failure (10), they also suffer the listed penalties when they fail by 10 or more below the opposing DC, Check, or Save. This can continue on to Failure (15) and further.

> **Example:** A Curse imposes the Blinded Condition on a failed Save, but has the following failure statements: “Failure (5): Deafened,” and “Failure (10): Doomed 1.” That means that the creature is both Blinded and Deafened if its Save is 5 below the Save DC, and the creature is also Doomed 1 if its Save is 10 below the Save DC.
