# Damage

## Degrees of Damage

Each Attack has a base amount of damage that’s dealt
on a Hit. This value is listed alongside the Weapon (see
“Equipment” on page 75) or in the Spell’s description
(see “Spellcasting” on page 54). If the Check beats the
targets Defense by 5 or more, the target takes extra damage
and may suffer additional effects (see “Check & Save
Outcomes” on page 29 for more information).

### Hit & Miss

When you make a Check against a target’s Defense, the
Check is considered a Miss if the result is below the target’s
Defense and it’s considered a Hit if the result is equal to or
above the target’s Defense.

### Hit Success (each 5)

An Attack deals +1 additional damage for every 5 the result of the Check is above the target’s Defense. If the result of the Check is 5 or more above the target’s Defense, it’s considered a Heavy Hit. If the result of the Check is 10 or more above the target’s Defense, it’s considered a Brutal Hit. Brutal Hits are considered Heavy Hits for purposes of effects that trigger on a Heavy Hit. 

> **DC Tip:** Heavy Hits are 5 over, Brutal Hits are 10 over, but if a Character ever manages to get 15 over a targets Defense I call this “Beyond Brutal”. Then I count by 5’s to see how many +1 bonus damage they get.

### Degrees of Damage Table

The table below shows how the damage of an Attack Check or Spell Check can change as determined by the result of the Check.

| Check vs Defense Result | Damage                       |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Lower                   | Miss                         |
| Equal or greater        | Hit: Base Damage             |
| +5 and greater          | Heavy Hit: Base Damage + 1   |
| +10 and greater         | Brutal Hit: Base Damage + 2  |

### Critical Hits

When you roll a 20 on a d20 for an Attack, it’s considered a Critical Hit. A Critical Hit automatically Hits the target, bypasses Damage Reduction, and deals an additional +2 damage.

> **DC Tip:** An Attack can score a Critical Hit without the result of the Check being 5 or more above the target’s Defense. When that happens, the Check is considered a Critical Hit and the target simply takes the base damage +2, but this scenario is rare. A Critical Hit will normally result in a Check that’s 5 or even 10 above the target’s Defense, causing the target to take +2 damage from the Critical Hit plus +1 additional damage for every 5 the result is higher than its Defense.

!!! note "Damage Calculation Sidebar"

    This is a way for both Players and Game
    Masters to add up their damage in a way
    that’s simple and quick. Once you Hit with an
    Attack, the GM will tell you if the Attack was a
    Heavy Hit or higher. This helps you determine
    how much additional damage your Attack
    deals (see the process shown below). The
    GM will apply any applicable Resistances or
    Vulnerabilities to determine the total amount
    of damage the target takes (see “Damage
    Modifications” on page 36 for more on the
    target reducing damage).

    *Adding Damage Order*

    Add up the damage totals in the following
    order:

    1. Base Damage: Start with the Base
    Damage of the Attack.

    2. Heavy & Critical Hits: Add any bonus
    damage from Critical Hits or Heavy Hits
    and higher.

    3. Action Points: Add any bonus damage
    from Action Points spent (Maneuvers,
    Class Features, AP Enhancements, etc.).

    4. Situational Bonuses: Add any bonus
    damage from situational bonuses
    (Weapon Passives, Class Features,
    Magic Items, etc.).

> **DC Tip:** Starting with the Base Damage is a great foundation,
and getting the Heavy Hit + out of the way first is nice. You’ll
get better at all the “by 5’s” math over time! Then you add
any damage gained by spending AP, then any passives. This
creates a great “checkpoin” system for you to mentally
navigate and keep things simple and quick.

> **Example:** A Rogue attacks a beast with his Shortsword (we
start off with a Base Damage of 1). They get a Brutal Hit and
gain +2 bonus damage on their hit (1 + 2 = 3). They target
has a condition on it which increases their damage by +1 (1 + 2 + 1 = 4).
They also got hit by the target this round and
gain the Weapon Passive of the Sword of +1. So now their
total damage is 5 (1 Base + 2 Brutal + 1 Cheap Shot + 1 Sword
Passive = 5 Total).

## Damage Types

There are 13 different damage types in the game, as seen
in the list below. Each damage type represents a different
method for harming a creature.

* **Bludgeoning Damage:** Things that bludgeon you, like a
hammer or fist.
* **Piercing Damage:** Things that pierce you, like an arrow or
fangs.
* **Slashing Damage:** Things that slash you, like a blade or
claw.
* **Fire Damage:** Things that burn you, like fire or other forms
of intense heat.
* **Cold Damage:** Things that freeze you. like ice or intense
cold.
* **Lightning Damage:** Things that shock you, like lightning or
other forms of electricity.
* **Sonic Damage:** Things that assault your hearing, like high
volume or concentrated sound.
* **Poison Damage:** Things that poison you, like toxins.
Corrosion Damage: Things that decay and wither you, like
acids and rust effects.
* **Psychic Damage:** Things that assault your mind, like
psychic attacks.
* **Radiant Damage:** Things that singe you, like holy light,
lasers, and radiation.
* **Umbral Damage:** Things that harm your soul, like dark or
eldritch power.
* **True Damage:** A special type of damage that can’t be
reduced by any means.

### Damage Type Categories

Some damage types are organized into categories, such as Physical, Elemental, and Mystical.

*   **Physical Damage:** Includes Slashing, Piercing, and Bludgeoning damage.
*   **Elemental Damage:** Includes Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Lightning, and Poison damage.
*   **Mystical Damage:** Includes Psychic, Radiant, Sonic, and Umbral damage.


## Damage Vulnerability, Resistance, & Immunity

Resistance is a way for creatures to reduce the damage
they take, while Vulnerability increases damage taken. The
source of what gives them this ability could come from a
natural ability they have, a Class Feature, Magic Items, etc.
Here are the different ways that these different effects work:

### Damage Resistance
*Resistance (X):* Damage taken of the specified type is
reduced by X each time the creature takes damage of that
type.

> **Example:** If you had Fire Resistance (2) and took 7 Fire
damage, you would instead take 5 Fire damage (you subtract
2 from the Fire damage taken, so 7–2 = 5).

*Resistance (Half):* Damage taken of the specified type is
halved (minimum of 1 damage reduced).

> **Example 1:** If you had Fire Resistance (Half) and took 7 Fire
damage, you would instead take 4 Fire damage (half of 7 is
3.5, rounded up is 4).

> **Example 2:** If you had Radiant Resistance and took
1 Radiant damage, the damage would be halved to 0.5
and rounded back up to 1 damage taken. However, since
Resistance reduces damage by a minimum of 1, the damage
would be reduced to 0.

### Damage Immunity
Damage taken of the specified type is reduced to 0.

> **Example:** If you had Cold Immunity and were dealt 7 Cold
damage, you would take 0 damage instead.

### Damage Vulnerability

*Vulnerability (X):* Increase damage taken by X each time
the creature takes damage of that type.

> **Example:** If you had Poison Vulnerability (2) and took 3
Poison damage, you would instead take 4 Poison damage
(you add 1 to the Poison damage taken, so 3 + 2 = 5).

*Vulnerability (Double):* Increases the Damage taken by 2
times of the specified type.

> **Example:** If a Werewolf has Vulnerability (Double) to
Silvered Weapons and takes 5 damage from an Attack, they
would instead take 10 damage (5 x 2 = 10).

## Damage Reduction (DR)

Damage Reduction (DR) grants Damage Resistance (Half)
against Attacks, except against Critical Hits and Heavy
Hits (or higher).

There are 3 types of Damage Reduction:
* **Physical Damage Reduction:** PDR protects you from
the following damage types: Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
Slashing.
* **Elemental Damage Reduction:** EDR protects you from the
following damage types: Cold, Corrosion, Fire, Lightning,
Poison, and Sonic.
* **Mystical Damage Reduction:** MDR protects you from the
following damage types: Radiant, Psychic, and Umbral.

> **DC Tip:** There can be specific types of DR for certain
Damage Types that special items or monsters have. You could
have something that even gives “Fire Damage Reduction”
for example.
Example: A creature makes an Attack to hit a target with
an PD of 10. The result of their Check is 12, which hits the
target and deals 4 Bludgeoning damage. The target has a
PDR, which provides Bludgeoning Resistance against this
Attack, and halves the damage to 2 (4 / 2 = 2). Alternatively, if
the result of the Check was 15, it would be 5 over the target’s
PD of 10, making it a Heavy Hit. In this scenario, the PDR is
bypassed, the damage isn’t reduced, and the target takes the
full 4 damage plus 1 damage for the Heavy Hit.

## Stacking Damage Vulnerabilities, Resistances, & Immunities

> **Example:** If you had Fire Resistance (1) from an Ancestry
Trait and Fire Resistance (1) from a Class Feature, these
Resistances would be replaced by Fire Resistance (Half)
instead. So if you took 4 Fire damage from an Attack,
the damage would be reduced by half down to 2 damage
(4 / 2 = 2).

### Damage Resistance X & Vulnerability X

A creature that gains Damage Resistance X or Damage
Vulnerability X from multiple sources they are all
added together.

#### Damage Resistance (Half) & Vulnerability (Double)

Multiple sources of Damage Resistance (Half) or Damage
Vulnerability (Double) do not stack.

> **Example:** If you had Lightning Resistance (Half) from a
Class Feature and Elemental Resistance (which includes
Lightning Resistance) from the EDR granted by your Armor,
you would still only take half damage when you take
Lightning damage (not a quarter of the damage, because they
don’t stack).

## Damage Modifications

Total damage is determined after all damage modifications
are taken into account. When a creature takes damage,
the total damage taken is determined by following the
steps below:

1. Adding & Subtracting
    * **Damage Resistance X:** its Resist X reduces the damage by
the value of X (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   * **Damage Vulnerability X:** its Vulnerable X increases the
   damage by the value of X (1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. Doubling & Halving
   * Damage Resistance (Half): The damage is halved
   (rounded up, minimum of 1 damage reduced).
   * Damage Vulnerability (Double): The damage is doubled
   (minimum of 1 damage taken).

If a creature has the same type and amount of Resistance
and Vulnerability, they cancel each other out (e.g. Fire
Resistance (1) & Fire Vulnerability (1), or Cold Resistance
(Double) & Cold Vulnerability (Double)).

> **DC Tip:** Basically any kind of addition or subtraction of
damage happens FIRST, then any multiplication or division of
damage AFTER.

> **Example 1:** A creature has Cold Resistance (1) from its
Ancestry, and Cold Vulnerability (Double) from a Monster
Effect. When that creature is Hit by an Attack that deals 5
Cold damage, the damage is reduced by 1 (Cold Resistance
(1)) to a total of 3, and then doubled (Cold Vulnerability) to
a total of 6.

> **Example 2:** A creature has Fire Vulnerability (1) from
its Ancestry, and Fire Resistance (Half) from the EDR
granted by its Armor. When that creature is Hit by an Attack
that deals 5 Fire damage, the damage is increased by 1
(Fire Vulnerability (1)) to a total of 6, and then halved (Fire
Resistance (Half) from EDR) to a total of 3.

## Managing Damage Multiples

### Multiple Damage Types

**Resistances:** When you take multiple types of damage that
you have Resistances to, you apply your Resistances to
each damage type individually.

> **Example:** You have Physical Resistance (Half) from PDR
granted by Armor and take 3 Piercing damage and 3 Slashing
damage from an Attack. The Piercing damage would be
reduced by half to 1.5, then rounded up to 2 damage taken.
The same would be true of the Slashing damage (2 damage
taken). You would take a total of 4 damage from the Attack.

**Bonus Damage:** When dealing bonus damage on an Attack
that deals more than 1 type of damage, you choose which of
those damage types the bonus damage increases.

> **Example:** A Barbarian Hits a target with an Attack using a
magical Hammer that deals 2 Bludgeoning damage and 2
Lightning damage. If the Barbarian is Raging at the time, they
deal +1 damage from their Rage Feature. The Barbarian can
choose to apply their Rage damage to the Bludgeoning or
Lightning damage.

### Bonus Damage Against Multiple Targets

If you add bonus damage to an Attack that targets multiple
targets, the bonus damage only applies to one target of your
choice. The Attack still benefits from Critical Hits, Heavy
Hits, and beyond against each target.

### Shared Damage

When 2 or more creatures share damage, divide the damage
by the number of creatures (rounding up), and distribute
the damage equally among the creatures. If the creatures
are sharing damage of multiple types, you calculate the
shared damager for each type taken (see example 3)

> **Example 1:** A Champion steps in front of an Attack against
an ally and they share the damage. If the total damage was
5, then each creature now takes 3 damage (half of 5 is 2.5,
rounded up to 3).

> **Example 2:** A creature is thrown 10 Spaces into a wall, taking
10 Bludgeoning damage upon impact. However, if 2 creatures
were to stand side-by-side in the thrown creature’s path, all
3 creatures would share the damage upon impact. The 10
damage would be divided by the 3 creatures, resulting in each
creature taking 3.33 Bludgeoning damage. No matter what
the fraction is, you always round up in DC20, so now each
creature takes 4 damage.

> **Example 3:** A Barbarian steps in front of an Attack against
an ally and they share the damage. If the total damage was
3 Bludgeoning and 2 Lightning damage, then each creature
now takes 2 Bludgeoning (half of 3 is 1.5, rounded up to 2).
and 1 Lightning damage.

> **DC Tip:** Yes this does mean that sharing damage might
result in the group as a whole taking more damage than if
they had not shared the damage. This is on purpose and also
accounts for everyone smashing into each other and truly
sharing the blow.
