# Checks & Saves

Whenever an attempt is made by a creature to perform an action that has a chance of success and failure, they make a Check or Save to determine the outcome of the attempt. The type of action the creature is attempting to perform determines whether they make a Check or a Save. When a creature makes a Check or Save, they roll a d20 and add any relevant bonuses which are determined by the type of Check or Save. 

## Checks:
When a PC initiates an action against another creature or obstacle, the GM might ask them to make a Check to determine if the activity is successful. The GM might also ask for a Check to be made when two or more creatures are engaging in a competition of skill against each other.

## Saves:
When a PC reacts against an effect being forced upon them, the GM might ask them to make a Save to determine if they’re successful at resisting the effect.

> **Example:** A Might Check would be to see if you can lift the heavy boulder that’s just sitting there, while a Might Save would be to see if you can stop a heavy boulder rolling down a hill at you!

## Willing Creatures:
Any creature can choose to fail a Check or Save. When they do, the result of their Check or Save is treated as a 0 for the purposes of degrees of success or failure (see Check and Save Outcomes), but the creature doesn't suffer the effects of a Critical Failure unless they choose to do so.

## Types of Checks

There are several types of Checks a GM might ask a creature to make, such as an Attack Check when attacking with a Weapon, a Spell Check when casting a Spell, a specific Skill Check when performing a test of skill, a specific Trade Check when performing a test of professional expertise, or a specific Flat Attribute Check performing a test of aptitude that doesn’t benefit from skill or expertise.

### Flat Attribute Checks:
When a creature attempts to perform an activity that doesn’t benefit from Mastery, they make a certain type of Flat Attribute Check, such as a Flat Might Check to lift a very heavy object or a Flat Intelligence Check to remember a conversation they once had.

### Attack Checks:
When a creature attempts to hit a target with an Unarmed Strike or Weapon, they make an Attack Check to determine if their attack hits the target.

### Spell Checks:
When a creature casts a Spell, they make a Spell Check to determine the potency of the Spell or if the Spell hits its target.

### Skill Checks:
When a creature attempts a test of skill, they might perform a Skill Check, such as an Influence Check to determine how convincing their argument is or a Trickery Check to determine if they can pocket an item without being noticed. See the Skills List for more information.

### Trade Checks:
When a creature attempts a test of professional expertise, they might perform a Trade Check, such as a Blacksmithing Check to determine the result of their efforts crafting a Weapon or a Theater Check to determine how well an audience responds to their performance (see “Trades” on page 13). 

### Language Checks:
These are used to see how well you can read, write, or speak using a language you have Limited Language Mastery in. You add your Charisma or Intelligence (your choice) to these Checks.

## Types of Saves

A creature can make a Save to resist an effect imposed against it by another creature, a trap, or a hazardous environment. The type of effect will determine which type of Save the creature makes: Might, Agility, Charisma, or Intelligence.

### Might Saves:
Resist effects that push you away, knock you down, or crush you.

### Agility Saves:
Resist effects that cause you to lose your balance or that can be avoided by successfully dodging out of the way.

### Charisma Saves:
Resist effects that attempt to dominate your mind or alter your emotions.

### Intelligence Saves:
Resist effects that attempt to read your thoughts, alter your memories, confuse you, or use illusions to deceive your senses.
