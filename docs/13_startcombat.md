# Starting Combat

## Combat Encounters

Combat Encounters serve to slow the flow of time, allowing
for precise resolution of actions during the chaos of battle.
Combat consists of a Player Character (PC) Team and
an opposing Enemy team. During Combat, time is divided
into Rounds, which are further divided into Turns. The
order each creature takes its turn in Combat is determined
by the Initiative Order.

## Encounter DC

The Encounter DC represents the overall challenge of
a battle, determining who reacts quickest and resolving
uncertain outcomes. The Game Master sets a single
Encounter DC, which serves as a baseline for the difficulty
of various actions, environmental hazards, or other obstacles
adventurers may face. The GM can refer to the Encounter
DC Table below for example Easy, Normal, and Hard
difficulty values for PC Levels 1 to 20.

### Encounter DC Table

| Level | Easy | Normal | Hard |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| 1     | 11   | 13     | 15   |
| 2     | 11   | 13     | 15   |
| 3     | 12   | 14     | 16   |
| 4     | 12   | 14     | 16   |
| 5     | 14   | 16     | 18   |
| 6     | 14   | 16     | 18   |
| 7     | 15   | 17     | 19   |
| 8     | 15   | 17     | 19   |
| 9     | 16   | 18     | 20   |
| 10    | 16   | 18     | 20   |
| 11    | 17   | 19     | 21   |

| 16    | 20   | 22     | 24   |
| 17    | 21   | 23     | 25   |
| 18    | 21   | 23     | 25   |

| 20    | 22   | 24     | 26   |

### Pre-Combat Aggression

The moment a Combat Encounter begins is not always a
matter of strict timing. The GM may determine that a PC’s
action (such as drawing steel, loosing an arrow, or invoking
a spell) triggers the clash, allowing them to carry out that
action before Initiative is rolled. However, if the enemy is
already on high alert or poised for battle, the GM may rule
that combat begins before the action can be completed,
requiring the character to take their aggressive move on
their first turn instead.

## Initiative

Before Combat begins, the GM will call for Initiative, which
determines the order in which each creature acts. The PC
Team competes against the Enemy Team to determine
which team takes the first Turn of Combat.

### Rolling for Initiative

When the GM calls for Initiative, each PC must make an
Initiative Check against the Encounter DC.

#### Making an Initiative Check

Roll a d20 and add your Combat Mastery and Agility to
the result. Bonuses and Penalties to Agility Checks don’t
effect Initiative Checks, unless otherwise stated.

**Initiative Check Formula**

```
d20 + Combat Mastery + Agility
```

> **DC Tip:** Initiative Checks aren’t considered Agility Checks for
the purposes of DisADV due to Heavy Armor with the Rigid
Property or other things that specifically affect Agility Checks.

#### Individual Outcomes

Use the following Success and Failure Statements to
determine the outcome of your Initiative Check:

* **Success:** You gain a d6 Inspiration Die, which you can
add to 1 Check or Save of your choice that you make
during this Combat. The Inspiration Die expires when
the Combat ends.
* **Critical Success:** You gain ADV on 1 Check or Save of
your choice during the first Round of Combat.
* **Critical Failure:** The first Attack made against you
during the first Round of Combat has ADV.

#### Party Outcomes

Use the following Success and Failure Statements to
determine who will take the first turn in Combat.

* **Success:** If at least 1/2 the PCs beat the Encounter DC,
the PC Team wins the first Initiative Turn of the Combat.
* **Failure:** If less than 1/2 the PCs beat the Encounter DC,
the Enemy Team wins the first Initiative Turn of the
Combat.

### Initiative Turns

An Initiative Turn is a creature’s opportunity to act during
Combat, allowing them to move, attack, cast spells, or
take other available actions. There are 2 types of Initiative
Turns: PC Turns and Enemy Turns. PC Turns belong to
members of the PC Team, while Enemy Turns belong to
members of the Enemy Team. The number of PC Turns
and Enemy Turns is equal to the number of PCs, ensuring
both Teams have an equal number of Turns.

> **Example:** If there are 3 PCs in Combat, there will be 3 PC
Turns and 3 Enemy Turns, for a total of 6 Initiative Turns
in the Combat.

#### Alternating Initiative Turns

Initiative Turns are arranged so that each Team takes one
Turn at a time, so when a member of one Team takes a Turn,
they’re followed by a member of the other Team taking a
Turn. This continues back and forth until each member of
each Team has taken a Turn.

> **DC Tip:** Using an alternating initiative system between teams
creates a dynamic ebb and flow in Combat, ensuring both
sides have opportunities to act before being overwhelmed.
This prevents the pitfalls of all PCs acting in one
overwhelming surge; either felling foes before they can react
or suffering a brutal onslaught should the enemy strike first.
By weaving turns between allies and adversaries, the battle
remains engaging, tactical, and fair.
 
**Illustration:** The image below illustrates the Initiative
Turn structure of two scenarios: the left scenario where the
PC team beats the Initiative DC (PC Team takes the first
Initiative Turn), and the right scenario where they fail
instead (Enemy Team takes the first Initiative Turn).

#### Choosing PC Turns

At the start of each PC Turn during the first Round of
Combat, the PC Team will decide which PC will take
that Turn. If multiple PCs want to take the same Turn, the
PC among them with the highest Initiative Check result
takes the Turn.

**Shared PC Turns:** If 2 or more PCs have the same Initiative
Check result, they can choose to share a Turn. When they
do, they act at the same time in the Initiative Order. They
can choose which of them acts first or alternate their actions
as desired.

> **Example:** The Barbarian and Champion are going at the
same time. They both spend 1 AP to charge in together and
Flank an enemy. The Champion trips the enemy target Prone,
and the Barbarian then makes an Attack Check with ADV
(target is Prone) and +2 bonus to Hit (target is Flanked).
They slay the enemy and charge off again together with their
remaining Action Points.

#### Choosing Enemy Turns
Enemies can each be assigned to their own Enemy Turns,
grouped together into a single Enemy Turn, or divided into
multiple Enemy Turns in any combination the GM chooses.

> **Example:** There are 4 enemies in Combat. The GM can divide
them into 4 different Enemy Turns, taking turns at different
times in the Initiative Order. Alternatively, the GM could
assign 2 enemies to 2 Turns each or 3 enemies to 1 Turn with 1
enemy alone in another.

**Assigning Enemies:** The GM can choose to assign enemies
to the Enemy Turns all at the same time or one at a time
as the Round unfolds. Enemies can be placed strategically
to heighten the difficulty of the encounter, introduced into
empty Enemy Turns later in the Initiative Order to bring
forth hidden threats, or positioned immediately after a PC
who has recently engaged or targeted them, allowing for a
response driven by the narrative.

#### Delayed Initiative

At anytime during your Turn, you can choose to
permanently move your Turn to a PC Turn of your choice
later in the Initiative Order. Alternatively, you can choose
to delay your Turn until after an enemy that you can see. If
that enemy occupies the last Initiative Turn in the Initiative
Order, then you create a new PC Turn to act after them.

**Regaining AP:** When you delay your place in the Initiative
Order, you don’t regain your spent Action Points until the
end of your new PC Turn in the Initiative Order.

> **Example:** The A Rogue takes their turn during the first PC
Turn in the Initiative Order. They want to delay their turn to
act at the same time as the Cleric, who takes their turn during
the 2nd PC Turn in the Initiative Order. The Rogue’s turn is
skipped over, and once its time for the Cleric to take their
turn, both the Rogue and the Cleric can take their turns at the
same time using the rules of Shared PC Turns.

!!! note "Game Master Initiative Sidebar"

    Here are some bonus Tips for GMs to handle Initiative in
    some unique situations.

    #### Enemy Groupings
    The GM may find it simple to group similar enemies
    together, rather than spacing them throughout the
    Initiative Order.

    > **Example:** If there are 4 Goblins with 2 Hobgoblins in a
    Combat Encounter with 4 PCs. The GM might add 2
    Goblins to Enemy Turn 1, 2 Hobgoblins to Enemy Turn
    2, and 2 Goblins to Enemy Turn 3.

    #### Unequal Number of Enemies
    If there are fewer enemies than there are Enemy Turns,
    then the GM chooses which Enemy Turns they occupy
    in the Initiative Order.

    #### Shared Enemy Turns
    When 2 or more PCs share a PC Turn, the GM can
    combine enemies from the next 2 Enemy Turns into 1
    Enemy Turn, preserving the alternating flow of combat
    between the PC Team and the Enemy Team.

    #### Empty Enemy Turns
    When an Enemy Turn becomes empty (whether because
    there’s too few enemies to fill all Enemy Turns or all
    enemies in an Enemy Turn have been defeated), that
    Enemy Turn remains in the Initiative Order but is skipped.
    If new enemies enter the Combat, the GM may assign
    them to any empty or occupied Enemy Turns, allowing for
    their inclusion in the Initiative Order without disrupting
    the flow of battle.

    #### Multiple Enemy Teams
    If there are two or more Enemy Teams, each Enemy
    Team will have their own Enemy Turns within the
    Initiative Order. These Initiative Turns will alternate so
    the PC Team, Enemy Team 1, and Enemy Team 2 will
    alternative Initiative Turns. To determine which of the
    Enemy Teams receives the first Initiative Turns, the GM
    can either use a Fate Check or simply choose based on
    strategy or narrative.

    #### NPC Team
    Any NPCs that aren’t hostile to the PC Team are
    considered their own NPC Team (such as civilians
    trying to escape a battle). The NPC Team has their own
    Initiative Turns separate from the PC Team and Enemy
    Team. These Initiative Turns will alternate so the PC
    Team, Enemy Team, and NPC Team will alternative
    Initiative Turns. The GM can assign NPCs to NPC Turns
    in the same way they assign enemies to Enemy Turns (see
    Choosing Enemy Turns earlier in this chapter).
    Important NPCs: The GM can choose to consider an
    allied NPC as a member of the PC Team to allow the
    NPC to act during PC Turns in the Initiative Order.
    When you do, consider the NPC as a PC for the purposes
    of determining the total number of Initiative Turns (the
    number of PC Turns and Enemy Turns is based on the
    number of PCs in the Combat). The NPC takes a PC
    Turn of the PC Team’s choice.

### Initiative Order

The chosen Initiative Turns become the Initiative Order,
which governs when each creature takes their respective
Turns in each subsequent Round of Combat. Once the first
Initiative Turn is assigned, Combat begins, all creatures
gain access to their Action Points, the first Round of
Combat begins.

#### Rounds of Combat

During Combat, creatures take Turns maneuvering around
the battlefield, attacking their enemies, or supporting
their allies. Once each creature has taken their first Turn
in Combat, the first Round of Combat is completed, and
the next Round can begin. Combat progresses, Round by
Round, until the PCs or their enemies prove victorious, and
the GM declares that Combat has ended.

#### Time in Combat
A Round of Combat lasts 12 in-game seconds, so 5 Rounds
equals 1 minute of in-game time. You can imagine each
creature’s Turn happening near simultaneously to each
other with some creatures acting split-seconds before others.

**Time in Combat**

```
1 Round of Combat = 12 seconds
5 Rounds of Combat = 1 minute
```

#### Duration in Rounds

The duration of some effects are measured in Rounds. The
duration of these effects are measured from the start of the
creature’s Turn they’re produced until the start of that
same creature’s Turn the specified number of Rounds later.

> **Example:** If an effect with a duration of 1 Round was
produced on a creature’s Turn, that effect would persist until
the start of that creature’s next Turn. If the effect lasted 2
Rounds, then the effect would persist until the start of that
creature’s Turn 2 Rounds later.
 
> **DC Tip:** Referring to the first Round of Combat means the
first 12 seconds, where each creature will have 1 Turn. But if a
PC uses an ability that lasts for 1 Round, that effect still lasts
12 seconds (which means each creature will have 1 Turn since
the use of that ability), and it would last until the start of that
creature’s next Turn.

#### Surprise in Combat

Not all combatants are prepared for battle, and some may
find themselves caught off guard at the start of a Combat
Encounter. To successfully ambush an opposing Team,
your side must be able to see them while remaining unseen
in return. If this condition is met and the GM calls for
Initiative, any creature unaware of the impending fight
gains the Surprised Condition until the end of their first
Turn in Combat, leaving them unable to act as battle erupts.

!!! note "Surprised (condition)"

    Your current and maximum AP are reduced by 2.

> **Beta Note:** Monsters with Legendary Action Points (LAP)
can take special actions in-between the PC’s turns, spending
up to a specified amount of LAP at a time (1 or 2 LAP per
turn). Delayed Initiative can create a scenario where all the
PCs delay their turns to act during the same PC Turn. This
means there’s only 1 big PC Turn, so the Monster with LAP
can’t spend all their LAP during the Round. Due to this issue,
please run your monsters with LAP using this rule until we
update it in the Monster Guide later: “If a monster with LAP
doesn’t spend all its LAP during the Round (between PC
turns), it can spend any remaining LAP it has at the end of the
Round, just before it regains all its LAP.”
