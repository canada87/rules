# Attacks & Defense

## Attacks

When a creature makes an Attack, it can do so by choosing a target within the Attack’s Range (Melee or Ranged) and by making a Check (Attack or Spell). How the Attack is resolved is determined by its Type and its Range. 

### Attack Types

There are 2 types of Attacks: Martial and Spell.

#### Martial Attacks

A creature makes a Martial Attack when it makes an Attack Check using a Weapon or Unarmed Strike against a target’s Defense.

*   **Unarmed Strike:** A Martial Attack made using any part of a creature’s own body, such as a punch, elbow, kick, knee, or headbutt.
*   **Weapon Attack:** A Martial Attack made using a Weapon, such as an Axe, Sword, or Bow. You can draw a Weapon as part of an Attack made using it.

#### Spell Attacks

A creature makes a Spell Attack when they make a Spell
Check against a target’s Defense. See “Spell Check vs
Defense” on page 56 for more information.

### Attack Ranges

There are 2 types of Attack Ranges: Melee and Ranged.

#### Melee Attack

When a creature makes a Melee Attack it can do so against a target within its Melee Range. A creature’s Melee Range is 1 Space, unless otherwise stated (see "Spaces & Distance").

#### Ranged Attack

When a creature makes a Ranged Attack it can do so against a target within its Range. The Range is determined by the type of Weapon it’s Attacking with or by consulting the Feature or Spell it’s using to make the Ranged Attack.

*   **Close Quarters:** A creature has DisADV on Ranged Attacks while an enemy is within 1 Space of it, provided the enemy isn’t Incapacitated.

#### Weapon Ranges

A Weapon that can be used to make a Ranged Attack has
a Range shown in parentheses after its Ammo, Toss, or
Thrown property (see “Weapons” on page 75).

*   **Normal Range:** The first number in the parentheses is a Weapon’s normal range. You can make an attack against any target within this range.
*   **Long Range:** The second number in the parentheses is a Weapon’s long range. You can make an attack with DisADV against targets within this range.

You can’t make attacks against targets beyond your Weapon’s long range.

> **Example:** A Short Bow has a range of (15/45), which means that they can make Attacks against targets between 1 and 20 Spaces, can make Attacks with DisADV against targets between 21 and 60 Spaces, and they can’t Attack targets that are 61 Spaces or farther away.

### Determining if an Attack Hits

When a creature makes an Attack, the result of the Attack
Check or Spell Check is compared to the target’s Defense
to determine whether or not the Attack Hits the target. The
Attack Hits if the result of the Attack Check is equal to or
greater than the target’s Defense.

> **Example:** A Level 4 Fighter’s highest Attribute is a 3 (Prime Modifier) and their Combat Mastery is 2 (1/2 its level). When the Fighter makes an Attack Check using a Longsword, they roll a d20 and add 5 (2+3). If they roll a 10 on the d20, the result is 15 (10 + 5). If the target’s Physical Defense is 15 or lower, the Attack hits, otherwise it misses.

## Defenses

When a creature makes an Attack (see the “Combat
Actions Sidebar” on page 39 ) to attempt to deal damage
to a target, the creature’s Check is compared against the
value of one of the target’s Defenses (Precision Defense or
Area Defense) to determine if the Attack hits.

### Precision Defense

Precision Defense (PD) measures a creature’s ability to
avoid attacks that can be dodged, such as a precise strike
or a ranged projectile. It reflects a combination of reflexes
and tactical foresight, making it a crucial defense against
single-target assaults.

#### PD Calculation

Your PD is equal to 8 plus your Combat Mastery, Agility,
and Intelligence. If you are wearing Armor or wielding a
Shield (see “Equipment” on page 75), you also add their
respective bonuses to your PD.

* **Agility:** Represents your reaction speed and physical
swiftness, allowing you to evade incoming attacks.
* **Intelligence:** Reflects your ability to anticipate danger
and position yourself wisely, giving you the time needed
to react.

##### PD Formula

```
8 + Combat Mastery + Agility + Intelligence + Bonuses
```

### Area Defense

Area Defense (AD) measures a creature’s ability to
withstand attacks that can’t be avoided, such as explosions,
shockwaves, or other widespread effects. Instead of
relying on dodging, Area Defense reflects raw endurance,
resilience, and sheer force of will to endure the assault.

#### AD Calculation

Your AD is equal to 8 plus your Combat Mastery, Might,
and Charisma. If you are wearing Armor or wielding a
Shield (see “Equipment” on page 75) , you also add their
respective bonuses to your AD.

* **Might:** Represents your physical toughness and
endurance, allowing you to absorb and resist bodily harm.
* **Charisma:** Reflects your inner resolve and commanding
presence, reinforcing your ability to withstand mental
and supernatural assaults.

##### AD Formula

```
8 + Combat Mastery + Might + Charisma + Bonuses
```
