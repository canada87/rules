## Equipment

### Weapons

Every Weapon has a Weapon Type (Melee or Ranged), a
Weapon Style (Axe, Sword, Hammer, etc.), and Weapon
Properties (Reach, Thrown, Two-Handed, etc.).

#### Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons : Melee Weapons and
Ranged Weapons.

##### Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons use your Melee Range (see “Melee
Attack” on page 31).

> **DC Tip:** Any Melee Weapon can be used as an Improvised Weapon to make a Ranged Attack. These Attacks have a Range of 5 spaces, are made with DisADV, and deal only half damage on a Hit. 

##### Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see “Ranged
Attack” on page 31).

> **DC Tip:** A Weapon with the Long-Ranged Property has a Range of 30/90. 

##### Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it,
unless it has the Two-Handed Property (requires 2
hands to Attack).

#### Weapon Styles

While a PC with Weapon Mastery is wielding a Weapon,
they can use that Weapon to benefit from its Weapon Style
passive effect.

* **Axe:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are
Bleeding.
* **Bow:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are
Slowed.
* **Chained:** Your Attacks ignore Shields and 1/2 Cover,
and you deal +1 damage against targets that are wielding
a Shield or behind 1/2 Cover.
* **Crossbow:** You deal +1 damage against the last creature
you Attacked with the Weapon since the start of your last
turn. Additionally, you do not have DisADV on Attacks
made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
* **Fist:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are
Grappled. Additionally, a Fist Weapon is considered to
be a free hand when Grappling.
* **Hammer:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are
Dazed or Petrified.
* **Pick:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are
Impaired.
* **Spear:** You deal +1 damage against a creature if you
moved 2 Spaces towards it immediately before making
the Attack or if it is on a Mount. Additionally, you do not
have DisADV on Attack Checks made using the Weapon
as a result of being underwater.
* **Staff:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are
Hindered.
* **Sword:** You deal +1 damage against creatures that are
Exposed.
* **Whip:** You deal +1 damage with Melee Attacks against
creatures that are farther than 1 Space from you.

> **Example:** A PC is wielding both an Axe and a Hammer. When they Hit a Bleeding creature with the Axe, they deal +1 damage against the target. They don’t deal this bonus damage when they Hit the Bleeding creature with the Hammer.

#### Weapon Properties

Weapons have certain properties that grant them different benefits or drawbacks.

*   **Ammo:** This Weapon requires ammunition to make Attacks. You can load a Weapon as part of an Attack made with it.
*   **Concealable:** You have ADV on the first Attack you make against a creature using a concealed Weapon. You can only gain this benefit against each creature once per Combat.
*   **Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
*   **Heavy:** The Weapon’s damage increases by 1.
*   **Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
*   **Long-Ranged:** Your Range increases to 30/90.
*   **Multi-Faceted:** The Weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you must choose which Weapon Style to use. The chosen Weapon Style determines the Attack’s damage type.
*   **Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
*   **Reload:** The Weapon’s damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon. 
    > **DC Tip:** If you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon using a Reaction, the Weapon must already be loaded to perform the Attack.
*   **Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you’re Hidden from. 
    > **DC Tip:** You must be both Unseen and Unheard to be Hidden. If you become seen while making the Attack, you’re no longer Hidden.
*   **Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10).
*   **Thrown:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20).
*   **Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it.
*   **Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the Weapon against targets within 1 Space of you. 
    > **DC Tip:**  The DisADV from Unwieldy stacks with the DisADV that Ranged Weapons get when used to make Attacks when an enemy is within 1 Space of you (making it DisADV 2).
*   **Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the Weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit using it.

##### Special Weapon Properties

*   **Returning:** When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.
*   **Capture:** When you Attack with this Weapon, you
instead make a Martial Check contested by the target’s
Physical Save. Success: The target is Grappled by the
weapon until it’s freed. Forced movement doesn’t end the
Grapple, but teleportation does. Success (10): The target
is also Restrained until it’s freed. A creature can spend
1 AP to make a DC 10 Might Check. Success: It can
free itself or another creature within its reach. Dealing 1
Slashing damage to the Weapon (PD 10, AD 10) ends
the effect and breaks it, freeing the creature without
harming it. A Weapon with this property deals 1 less
damage. This Property has no effect on creatures that are
formless, smaller than Small, or bigger than Large.

> **DC Tip:** Attacks that deal 0 base damage can still benefit
from bonus damage, such as Heavy Hits, Power Attack
Maneuvers, Class Features, etc.

#### Lacking Weapon Training

While wielding a Weapon you lack Training with, you do not benefit from its Weapon Style.

### Customized Weapons

You can create your own unique Weapons by following a 3 step process:

1.  Choose the Weapon Type.
2.  Choose the Weapon Style & Damage.
3.  Choose the Weapon Properties.

#### Step 1: Weapon Types

There are 2 types of Weapons: Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons.

##### Melee Weapons

Melee Weapons use your Melee Range (see "Melee Attack" on page 32) and deal 1 damage.

##### Ranged Weapons

Ranged Weapons have a Range of 15/45 (see "Ranged Attack" on page 32) and deal 1 damage. Additionally, they automatically gain the following properties: Ammo, Two-Handed, and Unwieldy.

##### Wielding a Weapon

A Weapon requires 1 hand when you Attack with it, unless it has the Two-Handed Property (requires 2 hands to Attack).

#### Step 2: Weapon Style & Damage

Each Weapon Style has a particular Weapon Style benefit and damage type (in parenthesis) as shown below:

> **DC Tip:** You can only benefit from a Weapon’s Style if you have Weapon Mastery. 

##### Melee Weapon Styles

*   **Axe:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Bleeding.
*   **Chained:** (Bludgeoning) Your Attacks ignore Shields and 1/2 Cover, and you deal +1 damage against targets that are wielding a Shield or are behind 1/2 Cover.
*   **Fist:** (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Grappled. Additionally, a Fist Weapon is considered to be a free hand when Grappling.
*   **Hammer:** (Bludgeoning) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Dazed or Petrified.
*   **Pick:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Impaired.
*   **Spear:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against a creature if you moved 2 Spaces towards it immediately before making the Attack or if it’s on a Mount. Additionally, you don’t have DisADV on Attack Checks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.
*   **Staff:** (Bludgeoning) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Hindered.
*   **Sword:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Exposed.
*   **Whip:** (Slashing) You deal +1 damage with Melee Attacks against creatures that are farther than 1 Space from you.

##### Ranged Weapon Styles

*   **Bow:** (Piercing) You deal +1 damage against creatures that are Slowed.
*   **Crossbow:** (Piercing, Requires: Reload Property) You deal +1 damage against the last creature you Attacked with the Weapon since the start of your last turn. Additionally, you don’t have DisADV on Attacks made using the Weapon as a result of being underwater.

> **DC Tip:** At the GM’s discretion, you can use a Melee Weapon Style on a Ranged Weapon, and vice versa. GMs, be careful when allowing this for certain passives. For example, the Whip, Chained, and Spear Styles on a Ranged Weapon generate far more value than is expected and designed for within the system. You also might want to consider removing the “no longer having DisADV on Attacks made underwater” aspect of the weapon too it it wouldn’t make sense. 

##### Changing Damage Type

Each Weapon Style comes with a default damage type (shown above), but you can switch any of these default damage types to a different one (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing).

#### Step 3: Weapon Properties

When you pick a Melee or Ranged Weapon during Character Creation (or craft one later), you can grant it 2 additional Weapon Properties. You can’t grant a Weapon the same Property more than once.

> **DC Tip:** The Two-Handed and Unwieldy properties given to Ranged Weapons do not give you additional properties. 

##### Property Requirements

If a Weapon Property has a requirement, the Weapon must meet that requirement before you can add that Weapon Property to it.

##### Melee Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Melee Weapons.

*   **(1) Concealable:** You have ADV on the first Attack you make against a creature using a concealed Weapon. You can only gain this benefit against each creature once per Combat.
*   **(1) Guard:** You gain +1 PD while wielding the Weapon.
*   **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property and Weapon Mastery) The Weapon’s damage increases by 1.
*   **(1) Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
*   **(1) Multi-Faceted:** The weapon gains a second Weapon Style. When you make an Attack with the Weapon, you must choose which Weapon Style to use. The chosen Weapon Style determines the type of damage dealt by the Attack.
*   **(1) Reach:** This Weapon adds 1 Space to your Melee Range when you Attack with it.
*   **(1) Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you’re Hidden from.
*   **(1) Toss:** You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (5/10).
*   **(1) Thrown:** (Requires: Toss Property) You can throw the Weapon to make a Ranged Martial Attack (10/20).
*   **(-1) Two-Handed:** The Weapon requires 2 hands when you Attack with it. Can not be taken with the Versatile Property.
*   **(-1) Unwieldy:** You have DisADV on Attacks made with the weapon against targets within 1 Space of you.
*   **(1) Versatile:** This Weapon can be wielded with 1 or 2 hands. When you wield the weapon with 2 hands, you gain a +2 bonus to Hit with it. Can’t be taken with the Two-Handed Property.

##### Ranged Weapon Properties

These Weapon Properties are available to Ranged Weapons. Additionally, you can spend 1 Property to remove the Two-Handed or Unwieldy Properties (or 2 Properties to remove both).

*   **(2) Heavy:** (Requires: Two-Handed Property and Weapon Mastery) The Weapon’s damage increases by 1.
*   **(1) Impact:** You deal +1 damage on Heavy Hits.
*   **(1) Long-Ranged:** Your Range increases to 30/90.
*   **(0) Reload:** The Weapon’s damage increases by 1, but you must spend 1 AP and use a free hand to reload the Weapon. 
    > **DC Tip:** If you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon using a Reaction, the Weapon must already be loaded to perform the Attack.
*   **(1) Silent:** When you make a Ranged Attack with the Weapon while Hidden, you remain Unheard by creatures you’re Hidden from.

##### Special Weapon Properties

*   **Returning:** (Requires: Toss Property) When you Miss a Ranged Attack with the Weapon, it returns to your hand.
*   **Capture:** (Requires: Chained or Whip Style) The Weapon’s damage decreases by 1. When you Attack with this Weapon, you instead make a Martial Check contested by the target’s Physical Save. Success: The target is Grappled by the weapon until it’s freed. Forced movement doesn't end the Grapple, but teleportation does. Success (10): The target is also Restrained until it’s freed. A creature can spend 1 AP to make a DC 10 Might Check. Success: It can free itself or another creature within its reach. Dealing 1 Slashing damage to the Weapon (PD 10) ends the effect and breaks it, freeing the creature without harming it. A Weapon with this property deals 1 less damage. This Property has no effect on creatures that are formless, smaller than Small, or bigger than Large.

### Reskinning Weapons

Ultimately the Style and Properties of a Weapon you create are purely mechanical. With approval from your GM you can re-flavor the weapon to look like anything you want. You could make a Weapon that looks like a Sword but uses the Axe Weapon Style (so that you benefit from your target Bleeding instead of being Exposed).

> **DC Tip:** The visual look of a weapon is just flavor. All similar-looking weapons don’t have to function the exact same. Maybe your sword has a serrated edge and that’s why you chose the Axe Style. 

### Armor

Wearing Armor can improve your Defense and provide
Damage Reduction. Creatures that aren’t wearing Armor
are considered Unarmored.

#### Armor Type

There are 2 types of Armor : Light Armor and
Heavy Armor.

##### Light Armor

Light Armor is a type of protection worn by most creatures
to protect them from injury. Leather coats, padded jackets,
and heavy robes are types of Light Armor.

**Non-Metal Armor:** Light Armor can be described to be
made of many things but is not made of enough metal
to be considered Metal Armor for the purpose of game
mechanics (Features, Spells, Weapon effects, etc.) unless
otherwise stated.

##### Heavy Armor

Heavy Armor is designed with greater attention in
protecting the wearer in traditional warfare, requiring
extensive combat training to use most effectively. Lamellar,
laminar, and plate armor are types of Heavy Armor.

**Metal Armor:** All Heavy Armor is considered to be Metal
Armor for the purpose of game mechanics (Features, Spells,
Weapon effects, etc.) unless otherwise stated.

**Impactful Unarmed Strikes:** Your Unarmed Strikes deal +1
damage on a Heavy Hits while wearing Heavy Armor.

#### Wearing Armor

It takes 1 minute to don or doff Light Armor, or 10 minutes
to do the same with Heavy Armor. You gain the benefits of
Armor while wearing it.

##### Lacking Armor Training

While wearing Armor that you lack Training in, you have
DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.

##### Damage Reduction

Some types of Armor grant Physical or Elemental Damage
Reduction (see Damage Reduction for more information).

#### Armor Examples

| Type               | PD | AD | PDR  | Speed | Agility Checks |

| - Deflecting       | 2  |    | Half | -1    | DisADV         | 
| - Fortified        |    | 2  | Half | -1    | DisADV         | 
| - Highly Defensive | 2  | 2  |      | -1    | DisADV         | 

#### Customized Armor

When you pick your Armor during Character Creation
(or craft one later), you choose for it to be Light or Heavy
Armor can grant it 2 points worth of Armor Properties
available to that Armor type. You can’t grant Armor the
same Property more than once, unless otherwise stated.

##### Light Armor Properties

type of Light Shield.

##### Heavy Shields

Heavy Shields are designed for warfare. A Tower Shield is
a type of Heavy Shield.

DisADV on Attack Checks and Spell Checks.

choice). You can spend a Minor Action to change which
wielded Shield to benefit from.
* You are immune to Flanking.

#### Shield Properties

Shields have certain properties that grant them
different benefits.

### Adventuring Supplies

#### Gauntlet

You can purchase Gauntlets from a Blacksmith (or they come automatically with Heavy Armor). Wearing a Gauntlet gives your Unarmed Strikes with that hand the Impact Weapon Property (+1 damage on Heavy Hits).

> **Beta Note:** Prices are not set for things like Gauntlets, so a simple 5g should be a good price for now. 

#### Healing Potions

Healing Potions are crafted to magically heal wounds when consumed. These are (usually red) vials of liquid that are in small doses but potent in healing.

##### Healing Potion Levels

Healing Potions have levels to them that increase in potency and cost.

#### Healing Potion Level Table

| Level   | Healing         | Price    |
|:--------|:----------------|:---------|
| X       | 2 x Level in HP | —        |
| 1st     | 2 HP            | 10g      |
| 2nd     | 4 HP            | 25g      |
| 3rd     | 6 HP            | 40g      |
| 4th     | 8 HP            | 60g      |
| 5th     | 10 HP           | 100g     |

#### First Aid Kit

A First Aid Kit is full of supplies and tools such as ointments,
tinctures, bandages, and other medicinal reagents. A fully
stocked kit contains 5 charges, which can be spent to
treat a creatures wounds or cure an ailment by taking the
Object Action.

* **Treat Wounds:** You treat a Bloodied creature’s wounds.
Make a DC 10 Medicine Check. Success: Target creature
regains 1 HP. Success (each 5): The creature regains +1
HP.
* **Cure Ailment:** You treat a Disease or Poison (of your choice)
afflicting the target. Make a Medicine Check against the
DC of the Disease or Poison. Success: You neutralize 1
Disease or Poison afflicting the target. Success (each 5):
The creature regains +1 HP.

##### Refilling a First Aid Kit

The reagents and bandages contained within the kit can
be found in most towns and climates. Enough supplies
for 1 charge can be bought for 5g at a general store.
Alternatively, a creature can use a Rest Action to scavenge
from an appropriate climate (GM’s discretion) with a DC
15 Survival Check. Success: The kit regains 1 charge.
Success (each 5): The kit regains +1 additional charge.

> **Beta Note:** Rest Actions will be expanded on in future updates. Basically you can do this as part of a Long Rest (8 hours).
