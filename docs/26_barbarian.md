## Barbarian

Barbarians charge into battle with reckless abandon, ignoring their own safety as they brush off damage and deal even more in return. They trade defense for more offense and let out blood-crazed battle cries. 

**Source of Power:** Barbarians become overtaken by a surge of strength called Rage. This can manifest as rage, possession, primal power, or something else entirely. A protective Barbarian could tap into their power if their friends are in danger. A frightened Barbarian could lash out when they’re scared. There are many possibilities for where a Barbarian’s power of Rage comes from.

> **DC Tip:** Or of course an ANGRY Barbarian might want to smash everything in sight!
