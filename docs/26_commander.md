## Commander

Commanders are the leaders of the battlefield, inspiring
their allies and leading them to victory. They can command
their allies to attack or move around the battlefield, and are
even able to “heal” allies by making them dig deep within
themselves to push forward in combat.

**Source of Power:** Commanders utilize their extensive
leadership skills and tactical battle knowledge. This could
come from being a war veteran, inspiring leader, or a
tactical mastermind.
