## Wizard

Wizards learn to master each of the Spell Schools to control them in a structured and efficient way. They utilize sigils on the ground to enhance certain types of magic while they push spells to their limits.

**Source of Power:** Wizards learn to use magic from a dedicated studying of the arcane through practicing lessons and reading tomes. This knowledge could come from a Wizard School they attend, a family tome that has been passed down generations, or even from a Spell Book they stole and just kept practicing with.

### Starting Equipment

* 1 set of Novice Light Armor
* X or Y “Packs” (we’ll have a list of adventuring packs to put here)

### Wizard Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Spell School Initiate
Choose a Spell School. You gain the following benefits:

* You learn 1 extra Spell from this Spell School.
* When you cast a Spell from the chosen Spell School, you can reduce its MP cost by 1. Its total MP cost before the reduction still can’t exceed your Mana Spend Limit. You can use this Feature once per Long Rest, but regain the ability to use it again when you roll for Initiative.

##### Arcane Sigil
You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to create a 1 Space diameter Arcane Sigil on the ground beneath you that lasts for 1 minute. When you create an Arcane Sigil choose 1 Spell School (Enchantment, Necromancy, Protection, etc.) or 1 Spell Tag (Fire, Cold, Teleportation, etc.). The Arcane Sigil radiates magic of the chosen type.

* **Using a Sigil:** While a creature is within the area of your Arcane Sigil, it has ADV on Spell Checks to cast or produce the effects of Spells with the chosen Spell School or Spell Tag.
* **Moving a Sigil:** You can spend 1 AP to teleport one of your Sigils within 10 spaces to your current space, but multiple Sigils can’t coexist in the same Space.

##### Spellbook (Flavor Feature)
You have a Spellbook containing all the Spells you know inscribed within it. You can learn additional Arcane Spells by inscribing them into your Spellbook. These additional Spells do not count toward your Spells Known limit in your Class Table. To inscribe a Spell into your Spellbook, you must either have a Spell Scroll or a page from another Spellbook that has that Spell inscribed on it. 

* **Inscribing Spells:** Inscribing a Spell into your Spellbook requires 1 hour of Light Activity per MP required to cast it at its base MP cost. 
Once you inscribe a Spell you know into your Spellbook, you can inscribe again into a different book provided you have writing tools and ink. Any book containing a Spell you inscribed within it is considered one of your Spellbooks. 
If a Wizard loses their Spellbook, they can still cast the Spells they have already learned before losing it, however they can’t learn new Spells using their Spellbook Feature until they obtain a new Spellbook that they can inscribe new Spells into it.

> **DC Tip:** A good rule of thumb for GMs is to allow a Wizard to learn a new Spell in this way once each level. They could find it on enemies, treasure rewards, downtime tasks, purchased from shops, etc. This time delay can both serve to balance this feature and to show that it takes time to learn and practice these new Spells added to their Spellbook.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Prepared Spell
When you complete a Long Rest, choose 1 Spell you know. The chosen Spell becomes your Prepared Spell until your next Long Rest. Your Prepared Spell gains the following benefits:

* **Mana Limit Break:** When you cast this Spell, you can increase your Mana Spend Limit by 1. You can use this Feature once per Long Rest, but you regain the ability to use it when you roll for Initiative.
* During a Spell Duel, Challengers have DisADV on Spell Checks to stop your Spell.

##### Arcane Points
You gain 2 Arcane Points, which you can spend in the following ways:

* You can spend any number of Arcane Points when you create an Arcane Sigil to add an equal number of Spell Schools or Spell Tags to the sigil (regardless of Mana Spend Limit).
* You can use Arcane Points in place of Mana Points for the Spell School that you chose from your Spell School Initiate Feature.

**Mana Spend Limit:** When you spend Arcane Points, the total number of Arcane Points and Mana Points spent can’t exceed your Mana Spend Limit.

**Regaining Arcane Points:** You regain half of your Arcane Points when you complete a Short Rest. You also regain all spent Arcane Points when you complete a Long Rest.

**Additional Arcane Points:** You gain 3 additional Arcane Points when you gain a Wizard Class Feature. You can only gain this benefit once per Level, up to a maximum of 8 Arcane Points.

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.
