# Prestige System

Characters that reach levels past 10th reach Prestige. The Prestige System is what characters access from levels 11-20 (and potentially beyond), allowing them to reach epic levels of power.

## Prestige Paths

When you want to continue your PCs level progression past 10th-level, you maintain your original Class but gain a “Prestige Path”. This lets you increase your PC to 20th-level. At 11th-level, you get a few extra features listed below based on which Prestige Path you choose.

> **DC Tip:** This Prestige Path is now considered your “Class Table” for instances where the rules reference your Class Table.

There are 3 different Prestige Paths. You can choose any Prestige Path that you want, but choose wisely because once you make this choice, it’s permanent. This will be the Path you progress down until level 20.

The following Prestige Paths are identical except for the following categories: HP, SP, MP, Techniques, and Spells.

### Prestige Leveling Table

This is the Table you’ll be referencing when you increase your level.
