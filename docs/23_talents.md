# Talents

PCs gain Talents at specific levels (as shown in their Class Tables) to improve their statistics or to gain new abilities.

## Talent Requirements

If a Talent has a requirement (such as a level requirement), you must meet that requirement to choose that Talent.

> DC Tip: The GM might also award Talents at key story moments or as rewards. Keep in mind however that these can be quite powerful, especially at early levels. 

## Talent Mastery Tables

When you choose a Talent, you gain additional Talent Mastery benefits from the Martial Talent Mastery or Spellcasting Talent Mastery (your choice).

> **Example:** If a Champion chooses the Martial Talent Mastery at level 2, they gain +1 SP, +1 Maneuver, and +1 Technique. If that Champion chose Spellcasting Talent Mastery instead, they would gain +2 MP, +1 Cantrip, and +1 Spell.

### Martial Talent Mastery

* **Combat Training:** Weapons
* **Maneuvers:** You learn all Attack Maneuvers. You learn additional Maneuvers as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Martial Talent Mastery Table.
* **Techniques:** The number of Techniques you know increases as shown in the Techniques Known column of the Martial Talent Mastery Table.
* **Stamina Points:** Your maximum number of Stamina Points increases as shown in the Stamina Points column of the Martial Talent Mastery Table.

### Martial Talent Mastery Table

| Martial Talents Gained | Stamina Points | Maneuvers Learned | Techniques Learned |
|---|--|-------------------|---|
| 1 | +1 | +1                | +1 |
| 2 |  | +1                |  |
| 3 | +1 | +1                | +1 |
| 4 |  | +1                |  |

### Spellcasting Martial Mastery

* **Spell List:** When you learn a new Spell, you can choose any Spell on the Spell List granted by the Spellcasting Class you’re taking the Feature from. You must follow any restrictions imposed by the Spellcasting Mastery you gained that Spell List from.
* **Cantrips Known:** The number of Cantrips you know increases as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spellcasting Talent Mastery Table. Cantrips are Spells with the Cantrip Spell Tag.
* **Spells Known:** The number of Spells you know increases as shown in the Spells Known column of the Spellcasting Talent Mastery Table. These can be Spells with or without the Cantrip Spell Tag.
* **Mana Points:** Your maximum number of Mana Points increases as shown in the Mana Points column of the Spellcasting Talent Mastery Table.

### Spellcasting Talent Mastery Table

| Spellcasting Talents Gained | Mana Points | Cantrips Learned | Spells Learned |
|---|---|--|----------------|
| 1 | +2 | +1 | +1             |
| 2 | +2 |  | +1             |
| 3 | +2 | +1 | +1             |
| 4 | +2 |  | +1             |

## Multiclass Talents

Multiclass Talents allow you to gain Features from other Classes, except Flavor Features (see Class Flavor Features below). The Features you take will be of lower level than your own Class, but this allows you to pick up powerful Features from other Classes and even Subclasses if you meet the requirements.

## Class Flavor Features

Once you gain 2 Class Features from the same Class, you automatically gain that Class’s Flavor Feature.

> Example: If a Wizard gains 2 Barbarian Features, they automatically gain the Barbarian’s Flavor Feature: Shattering Force. 

## Specific Damage Types

When you gain a Feature that references a damage type of a different Feature, you use that same damage type. If there are multiple choices of damage types to choose from, you must choose one when you gain the Feature.

> Example: The Cleric Feature Channel Divinity has an option (Censure Divine) that deals “Divine Damage” to nearby Celestials and Fiends. The Cleric normally choose their type of Divine Damage at level 1 when they gain the Cleric Order Feature. If a Fighter uses a Multiclassing Talent to gain the Channel Divinity Feature, they would need to choose a type of Divine Damage listed in the Cleric Order Feature.
