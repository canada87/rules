## Druid

Druids tap into the power of nature, drawing upon the
energies that flow through the world and creatures around
them. and connect to plants, animals, and the plane itself.
They can channel both the restorative and destructive
forces of nature and shapeshift into wild beasts.

**Source of Power:** A Druid’s connection to nature can come
from a deep respect, love, and appreciation of the natural
world. Some Druids are blessed by a god or spirit of nature,
granting them innate magical abilities. Others immerse
themselves in nature by living in the wild, communing with
the land and creatures to gain power and insight. They can
sense and connect to nature and use its magic as their own.

to shift back and forth between your True Form and any
Wild Forms you currently have available. Once per Long
Rest, you can transform without spending MP or using MP
enhancements.

When you transform from your Wild Form to your True
Form, your statistics return to normal. You immediately
revert to your True Form when your Wild Form HP is

changes (unless otherwise stated):

* **Stat Block:** You use the Wild Form Stat Block below to
determine your statistics.
* **Identity:** You maintain your personality, intellect, and
ability to speak.
* **Wild Form HP:** You gain a secondary pool of Wild Form

carries over to your own HP.

horns, fangs, etc.) which you can use to make Unarmed
Strikes that deal 1 Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing
damage (your choice when you use this Feature).

Class Features, except Druid Class Features, Subclass

or perform Techniques.

Form Traits of your choice. You can’t select negative
Beast Traits. When you use this Feature, you can spend
additional MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to gain 2
additional Trait Points per MP spent.

> **DC Tip:** Most animals can be modeled by giving them the
Keen Senses and Skillful Traits.

##### Wild Form Stat Block
Small or Medium Beast (your choice)

|       |          |           |      |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|
| HP    | 2        | AP        | same | 
| PD    | 8+CM+PM  | PDR       | 0    | 
| AD    | 8+CM+PM  | MDR       | same | 
| Speed | 5        | Masteries | same | 
| Prime | Same     | Save DC   | same | 
| MIG   | 1        | CHA       | same | 
| AGI   | 1        | INT       | same | 

> **DC Tip:** Shapeshifting presents a unique problem for players,
since they can have Mastery in something that’s physically
difficult or even impossible for them. Fish don’t pick locks
and slugs can’t intimidate, but maybe a monkey can. Consider
changing DCs for Checks in some animal forms.

##### Wild Speech (Flavor)
You learn the Druidcraft Cantrip and can choose 1 of the
following options:

* **Animals:** You can understand and speak with Beasts in
a limited manner. You can understand the meaning of
their movements, sounds, and behaviors, and they can
understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, and
emotions.
* **Plants:** You can understand and speak with Plants in a
limited manner. You can understand the meaning of their
swaying, folding, unfolding of their leaves and flowers,
and they can understand the meanings of simple words,
concepts, and emotions.
* **Weather:** You can reach out to nature and cast the
Commune with Nature Spell as a Ritual once per Long Rest.

!!! note "Wild Speech Sidebar"

    One thing to keep in mind when communicating with plants and animals is that they have a very different worldview than people.

    ##### Communicating with Animals

    * **The World:** An animal might know a lot about the region it lives in, such as local sources of food and water, the presence of other animals, and the location of roads and shelters of nearby savage and civilized societies.
    * **Other Inhabitants:** An animal might only recognize the existence of creatures as prey (deer, sheep, and rabbits) and predators (bears, tigers, and wolves).
    * **Quirks:** If asked a question, an animal would respond with words rather than sentences, such as “cold”, “hungry”, “scared”, and “safe”. They are instinctual creatures that operate on emotion.

    ##### Communicating with Plants

    * **The World:** A plant might not be able to understand the possibility of other locations, and may describe creatures as having appeared then disappeared with no notion of where they came from or went to.
    * **Other Inhabitants:** A plant might only recognize the existence of creatures as friends (bees, birds, and frogs) and enemies (rabbits, deer, and lumberjacks).
    * **Passing of Time:** A seedling might consider a recent event something that happened a moment ago and an ancient event something that happened yesterday. An ancient oak tree might consider a recent event something that happened 10 years ago and an ancient event something over 100 years ago.
    * **Expertise:** A plant may be able to describe in keen detail the different kinds of rains, storms, quality of soil, and various local bugs and herbivores.


!!! note "WILD FORM TEMPLATES SIDEBAR"

    There are a ton of options you can use to
    make your Wild Form unique, here’s some
    good ideas to get you started.

    Slashing Damage.

    and Athletics both increase by 1, up to
    your Skill Mastery Cap. If your Mastery with
    Acrobatics or Athletics is already equal to
    your Skill Mastery Cap, you instead gain ADV
    on the Check.

    **Infiltrator**

    * **(2) Size:** Your size changes to Tiny.
    * **(1) Skillful:** Your Skill Mastery in Stealth and
    Awareness both increase by 1, up to your

free at anytime.
