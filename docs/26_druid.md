## Druid

Druids tap into the power of nature, drawing upon the energies that flow through the world and creatures around them, and connect to plants, animals, and the plane itself. They can channel both the restorative and destructive forces of nature and shapeshift into wild beasts.

**Source of Power:** Druids' connection to nature can come from a deep respect, love, and appreciation of the natural world. Some Druids are blessed by a god or spirit of nature, granting them innate magical abilities. Others immerse themselves in nature by living in the wild, communing with the land and creatures to gain power and insight. They can sense and connect to nature and use its magic as their own.

### Druid Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Druid Domain
You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to create your own Druid Domain that includes small plant life, sand, shallow water, or other naturally occurring features. You create up to 8 Domain Spaces along the ground or walls. The first Domain Space must be within 1 Space of you, and each additional Domain Space must be adjacent to another Domain Space.

* **Domain Spaces:** The area is considered to be Difficult Terrain for creatures of your choice, and when you cast a Spell, you can do so as if you were standing in any Space within your Domain.
* **Losing Domain Spaces:** A Domain Space also disappears if you end your turn farther than 15 Spaces away from it or you die.

**Domain Actions** While you have Domain Spaces, you can take any of the following Domain Actions:

* **Nature’s Grasp:** You can spend 1 AP to force a creature of your choice within your Domain to make a Repeated Physical Save against your Save DC.
    * **Save Failure:** The target is Grappled for 1 minute or until your Druid Domain ends.
* **Move Creature:** You can spend 1 AP to move a creature Grappled by this feature up to 2 Spaces within your Domain.
* **Move Object:** You can take the Object Action to use this feature to interact with any object within your Domain as if you were standing in any of your Domain Spaces. When you do, you can move the object up to 5 Spaces within your Domain.
* **Wild Growth:** You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to make a DC 10 Spell Check to heal a target within your Domain.
    * **Success:** The target immediately regains 1 HP. For the next minute, they regain an additional 1 HP each time they end their turn within your Domain. 
    * **Success (each 5):** They immediately regain +1 HP.
    * **Failure:** The target only regains 1 HP immediately.

##### Wild Form
You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to transform into a Wild Form of your choice. You can spend 1 AP on your turn to shift back and forth between your True Form and any Wild Forms you currently have available.

**True Form**
When you transform from your Wild Form to your True Form, your statistics return to normal. You immediately revert to your True Form when your Wild Form HP is reduced to 0 or you die.

**Wild Form**
When you transform from your True Form into your Wild Form, you gain the Wild Form’s current Wild Form HP (see Wild Form HP below), retaining any HP losses.

* **Duration:** Each Wild Form remains available for a number of hours equal to your Combat Mastery or until its Wild Form HP is reduced to 0.
* **Multiple Forms:** You can have up to 2 Wild Forms at a time, but each one must have different Traits (see Traits below). If you use this Feature while you already have 2 Wild Forms available, you must choose which of them the new Wild Forms replaces.
* **Equipment:** Your equipment falls to the ground or merges into your Wild Form (your choice for each item). You gain the benefits of Magic Items merged with your Wild Form, but you can’t activate them or spend their charges.

**Statistics**
While in your Wild Form, you are subjected to the following changes (unless otherwise stated):

* **Stat Block:** You use the Wild Form Stat Block below to determine your statistics.
* **Identity:** You maintain your personality, intellect, and ability to speak.
* **Wild Form HP:** You gain a secondary pool of Wild Form Health Points, which is 2 with a maximum of 2. Damage and healing effects target your Wild Form HP before your True Form HP, and any excess damage or healing carries over to your True Form HP.
* **Natural Weapon:** You have Natural Weapons (claws, horns, fangs, etc.) which you can use to make Unarmed Strikes that deal 1 Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage (your choice when you use this Feature).
* **Features & Talents:** You don’t benefit from Talents or Class Features, except Druid Class Features. Additionally, you can’t cast Spells or perform Techniques.
* **Traits:** You don’t benefit from your Ancestry Traits, but you gain 3 Trait Points to spend on Beast Traits or Wild Form Traits of your choice. When you use this Feature, you can spend additional MP (up to your Mana Spend Limit) to gain 2 additional Trait Points per MP spent. 

> **DC Tip:** Most animals can be modeled by giving them the Keen Senses and Skillful Traits.

##### Wild Form Stat Block
Small or Medium Beast (your choice)

|           |         |     |      |
|-----------|---------|-----|------|
| HP        | 2       | AP  | same | 
| PD        | 8+CM+PM | PDR | 0    | 
| MD        | Same    | AP  | same | 
| Speed     | 5       | AP  | same | 
| Masteries | Same    | AP  | same | 
| Prime     | Same    | AP  | same | 
| MIG       | 1       | AP  | same | 
| AGI       | 1       | AP  | same | 

> **DC Tip:** Shapeshifting presents a unique problem for players, they can have Mastery in something that is physically difficult or even impossible for them. Fish don't pick locks and slugs can't intimidate but maybe a monkey can. Consider changing DCs for Checks in some animal forms.

##### Wild Speech (Flavor)
You learn the Druidcraft Cantrip and can choose 1 of the following options:

* **Animals:** You can understand and speak with Beasts in a limited manner. You can understand the meaning of their movements, sounds, and behaviors, and they can understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, and emotions.
* **Plants:** You can understand and speak with Plants in a limited manner. You can understand the meaning of their swaying, folding, unfolding of their leaves and flowers, and they can understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, and emotions.
* **Weather:** You can reach out to nature and cast the Commune with Nature Spell as a Ritual once per Long Rest.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Nature’s Rest
When a creature completes a Short Rest while within 10 Spaces of you, they regain 1 Rest Point, provided they are in an area of naturally occurring terrain (or your Druid Domain).

##### Nature’s Veil
You can spend 2 AP and 1 MP to change the weather for 10 minutes in a 5 Space Sphere centered on yourself. The area doesn’t move with you. Choose 1 of the weather types below:

* **Clear:** The area becomes subtly illuminated by sunlight or moonlight (your choice) and any naturally occurring effects (such as rain and fog) in the area disappear. You and your allies have ADV on Awareness Checks to see things within the area.
* **Elements:** The area becomes saturated with a weather element of your choice. Creatures within the area gain Vulnerability (1) to 1 of the following damage types of your choice: Cold, Fire, or Lightning.
* **Obscure:** The area becomes obscured with light fog, dust, smoke, or another naturally occurring effect. Everything in the area becomes Partially Concealed. Creatures within 1 Space of each other can see each other normally.

> **DC Tip:** Creatures have DisADV on Awareness Checks to see things that are Partially Concealed.

* **Windy.** The area becomes buffeted by winds. Ranged Attacks that target PD within the area have DisADV and all fires within the area that aren’t fueled by magic become extinguished.

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.

#### Wild Speech Sidebar
One thing to keep in mind when communicating with plants and animals is that they have a very different worldview than people.

##### Communicating with Animals

* **The World:** An animal might know a lot about the region it lives in, such as local sources of food and water, the presence of other animals, and the location of roads and shelters of nearby savage and civilized societies.
* **Other Inhabitants:** An animal might only recognize the existence of creatures as prey (deer, sheep, and rabbits) and predators (bears, tigers, and wolves).
* **Quirks:** If asked a question, an animal would respond with words rather than sentences, such as “cold”, “hungry”, “scared”, and “safe”. They are instinctual creatures that operate on emotion.

##### Communicating with Plants

* **The World:** A plant might not be able to understand the possibility of other locations, and may describe creatures as having appeared then disappeared with no notion of where they came from or went to.
* **Other Inhabitants:** A plant might only recognize the existence of creatures as friends (bees, birds, and frogs) and enemies (rabbits, deer, and lumberjacks).
* **Passing of Time:** A seedling might consider a recent event something that happened a moment ago and an ancient event something that happened yesterday. An ancient oak tree might consider a recent event something that happened 10 years ago and an ancient event something over 100 years ago.
* **Expertise:** A plant may be able to describe in keen detail the different kinds of rains, storms, quality of soil, and various local bugs and herbivores.

#### Wild Form Traits
Below is a list of repeatable and unique Wild Form Traits. You can choose repeatable traits multiple times, but unique traits only once.

##### Unique Traits

* **(2) Size:** Your size changes to Tiny or Large (your choice).

##### Repeatable Traits

* **(1) Attribute Increase:** You gain +2 to Might or Agility (your choice), up to your Attribute Limit.
* **(1) Defensive:** Your PD or MD increases by 2 (your choice).
* **(1) Healthy:** You gain +1 maximum HP.
* **(1) Resistance (1):** Choose a Physical or Elemental damage type. You gain Resistance 1 to the chosen damage type.
* **(1) Skillful:** You gain Skill Mastery in 2 of the following Skills of your choice, up to your Skill Mastery Cap: Acrobatics, Animal, Athletics, Awareness, Intimidation, Stealth, or Survival. If your Mastery with the chosen Skill is already equal to your Skill Mastery Cap, you instead gain ADV on the Check.
* **(1) Swift:** Its Speed is increased by 1 Space (you can choose this Trait up to 5 times).
