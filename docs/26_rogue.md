## Rogue

Rogues are skilled, evasive, and cunning. They impose
conditions onto enemies, then exploit those weaknesses to
inflict even more harm.

**Source of Power:** Rogues can pinpoint and take advantage
of the weaknesses of their enemies and use their nimbleness
and cunning to get what they want, in combat and out.
They could learn this from being a petty thief, a former
noble, or an assassin in training.

When you make an Attack with a Weapon, you can spend
1 SP to force the target to make a Physical Save against
your Save DC. Save Failure: Until the start of your next

can be concealed in normal conversation and written
communications. This allows you to leave simple messages
such as “Safety” , “Threat” , or “Wealth” , or mark the
location of a cache, a secret passageway, a safehouse, or an
area of danger.

> **DC Tip:** DC Tip: This could be anything from the slang of the slums,
to the fancy language of the upper classes. It could even be
more specific as some kind of bizarre double speak between
twin siblings or between the political elite. If the Player
doesn’t know what to choose for this, they can always defer
to a generic thieves guild option.

that fulfills at least one of the following:

* It’s Flanked or Prone.
* It has any Condition other than Invisibile.

## SubClasses

### SubClass: Long Death

#### Thousand Cuts

When a creature fails its Save against your Debilitating
Strike, it also begins Bleeding (even if it’s immune to
the Condition). If a creature is affected by Bleeding from
this Feature, the DC to end the Bleeding Condition is
equal to your Save DC and it can no longer be ended by
regaining HP.

> **DC Tip:** These Rogues are able to apply magic or alchemical
toxins to their blades that eat away at their targets over time,
even things like Elementals or Undead that don’t have blood.
The specific narrative reasoning is up to you.

#### Hundred Ways to Die (Flavor Feature)
You are an expert at studying and identifying weaknesses in
bodies and how best to kill creatures. You have ADV on any
Check made to determine how something died or could die
easier. This also extends to poisons, toxins, or identifying
other materials used to kill.

make an Attack against a creature with a Condition, you
can forgo your Cheap Shot damage to force the target to
make a Charisma Save. Failure: The target is Taunted
until the end of your next turn.
* **Riposte:** When a creature within your Melee Range
misses you with an Attack, it provokes an Opportunity
Attack from you.

#### Tall Tales (Flavor Feature)

You know how to play to a crowd. You can spend up to 5
minutes telling a story to a crowd of creatures (that are not
immediately hostile to you) and keep their rapt attention
the entire time. During this story, creatures within the
crowd have DisADV on Awareness Checks.

> **DC Tip:** A creature with DisADV on Awareness would have a
-5 penalty to their Passive Awareness.
