# Techniques

### Learning Techniques

Martial Classes learn new Techniques at certain levels from the Techniques Known column in their Class Table.

### Techniques List

**BETA RULE:** There’s only 1 Technique List that ALL Martial and Hybrid Classes have access to. There’s potential to change this to be Class specific lists or grouped lists (like how Spell Lists work), or they might just stay the same.

### Technique Attack Checks

*   **Maneuvers:** When you make an Attack Check as part of a Technique, you can spend additional AP to perform Attack or Save Maneuvers as part of that Attack Check. When you do, the Maneuvers only apply to 1 target of the Attack.
*   **Weapon Style:** When you make an Attack with a Weapon that Hits multiple creatures, the Weapon Style benefit applies to each target individually.

> Example: If you make an Attack with a Sword against 3 creatures using the Whirlwind Technique, each Exposed creature takes +1 damage from the Attack because of the Sword Weapon Style bonus damage. If 2 of the 3 targets are Exposed, then the 2 Exposed creatures take 1 more damage than the creature that's not Exposed.

### Technique Enhancements

Technique Enhancements allow a Martial character to increase the potency of their Techniques by spending additional SP on the Technique. Technique Enhancements are specific to each Technique and are included in a Technique’s description. Many Technique Enhancements increase a Technique’s damage (if applicable), its duration, its range, its number of targets, or its Area of Effect (if applicable).

**Performing a Technique Enhancement:** When you perform a Technique, you can spend additional SP to perform a Technique Enhancement as part of the Technique. If the Technique requires an Attack Check, you must choose to do so before you make the Check. You can perform the same Technique Enhancement only once per Technique, unless it’s otherwise stated.

> DC Tip: Remember that you can use AP to perform a Maneuver to add to the Attack Check of the Technique as well.

### Forbearance

When a creature you can see within 1 Space is targeted by an Attack, you can spend 1 AP and 1 SP as a Reaction to become the new target of the Check, and choose to switch places with the original target (if it's willing).
