## Champion

Champions are weapon and armor specialists that push
themselves to the limit in combat. They are able to master
a wide variety of weapon types and learn their enemies as
they fight them.

**Source of Power:** Champions train intensely to master all
types of weapons and armor. They could be outfitted in
heavy armor and a shield, swing a greatsword with ease, or
become a highly trained archer.

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Champion Stamina
You regain 1 SP when you perform 1 or more Maneuvers as
part of an Action, provided you don’t spend SP as part of
that Action.

> **Example:** If you spend 1 AP to make a Martial Attack and then spend 3 AP to perform 3 Maneuvers on the Attack, you would only regain 1 SP.

* **Weapon Master:** At the start of each of your turns, you
can freely swap any Weapon you’re currently wielding in
each hand for any other Weapon.

Once per Combat, when you perform a Technique you

* **Advance:** You gain the benefits of the Move Action
and ADV on the next Physical Check you make.
* **Second Wind:** Once per Combat when you start your turn
Bloodied, you can regain 2 HP and 1 SP.

##### Know Your Enemy (Flavor Feature)
You can spend 1 minute observing or interacting with a creature out of Combat (or spend 1 AP in Combat) to learn information about its physical capabilities compared to your own. Choose one of the following stats of the creature to assess: Might, Agility, PD, PDR, and HP. Make a DC 10 Knowledge or Insight Check (your choice). 

* **Success:** You learn if the chosen stat is higher, lower, or the same as yours.

> **DC Tip:** If a creature is better than most at disguising or concealing their “true power” then the GM can increase the DC for this Feature to be used against it. The GM will not tell you if the DC is higher or if you roll higher than a 10 and still fail… they can lie about what information you gather.
