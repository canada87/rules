## Rogue

Rogues are skilled, evasive, and cunning. They impose conditions onto enemies, then exploit those weaknesses to inflict even more harm.

**Source of Power:** Rogues can pinpoint and take advantage of the weaknesses of their enemies and use their nimbleness and cunning to get what they want, in combat and out. They could learn this from being a petty thief, a former noble, or an assassin in training.

### Rogue Class Features

#### Level 1 Class Features

##### Rogue Stamina
You regain 1 SP when you:

* Hit a Flanked target.
* Hit a target that’s affected by a Condition.
* Once per turn, when you use Cunning Action.

##### Cunning Action
You gain 2 Spaces of movement when you take the Disengage, Feint, or Hide Actions. You can use this movement immediately before or after you take the Action.

##### Debilitating Strike
When you make an Attack with a Weapon, you can spend 1 SP to force the target to make a Physical Save against your Save DC. **Save Failure:** Until the start of your next turn, the target suffers 1 of the following effects of your choice: Deafened, Exposed, Hindered, or Slowed 2. A target can’t be affected by the same option more than once at a time.

##### Skill Expertise
Your Skill Mastery Limit increases by 1, up to Grandmaster (+10). You can only benefit from 1 Feature that increases your Skill Mastery Limit at a time. Additionally, you gain 1 Skill Point.

##### Thieves’ Cant (Flavor Feature)
You become Fluent in another Mortal Language of your choice. Additionally, you know how to communicate in a secret mix of code words, slang, signs, and symbols called Thieves’ Cant. Communicating in this way allows you to hide secret messages in normal conversation and writing. Using Thieves’ Cant you can leave simple messages, such as marking the location of a cache, a secret passageway, a safehouse, or an area of danger.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Cheap Shot
You deal +1 damage on Martial Attacks against creatures that are Flanked or subjected to at least 1 Condition.

> **DC Tip:** While Unseen, creatures are Exposed to you (your Attacks against them have ADV) and Hindered against you (they have DisADV on Attacks).

##### Evasion
While not wearing Heavy Armor or wielding a Heavy Shield, when an effect that you can see deals damage to you, you can spend 1 AP as a Reaction to halve the damage against you. If the triggering effect deals half damage on a Miss (or when you succeed a Save), you take no damage instead.

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.
