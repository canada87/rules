# DCs in DC20

## Difficulty Class (DC)

Difficulty Class (DC) is the number that a Game Master
sets as the level of difficulty required to be able to succeed
in a given situation. Lockpicking a door, climbing a
steep mountain, trying to persuade someone to give you
something, or even trying to resist a Spell’s effect over
you all have a DC that needs to be met or exceeded in
order to succeed.

You always roll a D20 and add whatever relevant modifiers
there are based on what the Game Master asks for. Usually
(unless you are attacking something) this is going to be a
Check or a Save.

## Setting a DC “by 5’s”

Checks (in general) work on a “by 5’s” system. This helps
to stay consistent and fair in a GM’s ruling of how difficult
something is to accomplish. Below is a chart with a quick
reference, and examples are listed below that. These are
meant to give Game Masters a foundation to use and players
a general expectation to understand. If you want to get
more specific, you can set any number you want as the DC.

> **DC Tip:** I personally always have checks be “by 5’s”, but when it comes to setting a DC for combat-related things I use more specific numbers. Things like the DC of a Trap or the DC of sneaking by a particular creature might be something like a 12, 14, 17, etc.

### DC Task Difficulty

| DC    | Task Difficulty   |
|-------|-------------------|
| 5     | Very Easy         |
| 10    | Moderate          |
| 15    | Hard              |
| 20    | Very Hard         |
| 25    | Extremely Hard    |
| 30    | Near Impossible   |

Most DCs that you will ask for will either be 10, 15, or 20. Once PCs get to higher levels and start trying to accomplish crazier and crazier things, a DC 25 or even 30 might come up.

* **DC 5:** This is a Very Easy DC that probably shouldn’t even be asked for and would be easily accomplished by just about anyone, regardless of training. I usually don’t ask for a Check if the DC would be 5.
* **DC 10:** This is a Moderate DC that should be doable, especially if you’re skilled at it. Most checks that are simple enough but still have an element of doubt to if the PC can do it or not are a DC 10 for me.
* **DC 15:** This is a Hard DC to hit for those who aren’t skilled in this Check. If a PC has a decent modifier of a +5 in a Skill, they would have around a 50% chance to succeed on this. This is my “go to DC” for when I REALLY don’t know if someone can do it or not and is one step beyond the “moderate” DC of 10.
* **DC 20:** This is a Very Hard DC to hit unless you have training in this Skill. Even PCs with a +10 modifier would hit a DC 20 about 50% of the time. This DC represents something of great worth and something that would be “Very Hard”.
* **DC 25:** This is an Extremely Hard DC to hit. Even if the PC has a +5 in their skill, they would need a Nat 20 to even succeed on this DC. I reserve this for things that would be next to impossible at early levels of play, and would ONLY be possible if the character that was attempting to hit this DC BOTH had a good modifier to the roll AND rolled well.
* **DC 30:** This is a Near Impossible DC to hit. It takes a LOT for a character to get a +10 in a skill… and even if they did have a +10… they would still need a Nat 20 to hit this… that is CRAZY. Reserve this DC for those checks that are possible for the PC to accomplish… but it’d have to be a “miracle” for it to happen. 

> **DC Tip:** The best way I can describe it is this: if I have a little bit of doubt that a PC could do it, the DC is 10… if there is a decent amount of doubt that they could accomplish this, then the DC is 15… but if I am VERY doubtful that the PC could accomplish this, the DC is 20 and they better roll really high!

## Great Success and Failure

With 5 point increments you can also dial things up or down based on if they beat the Check by 5 or fail the Check by 5. If the DC for climbing a castle wall is 15, a 15 would exactly succeed, but if they beat it by 5 and got a 20 or higher, maybe something cool happens like the guard at the top doesn't see them at all and they have a moment of surprise! On the other hand, if they got a 10 or lower on that same check (failing it by 5), maybe they take too long climbing the wall and the guards spot them!

This “by 5’s” system also connects to the core of DC20’s combat system. In Combat, when you roll 5 over the target's AC you deal more damage than you would normally, so it also can be true for Skill Checks.

> **Example:** Here is a general outline for what each possible scenario might look like in a given situation. This example is for a DC of 20: 14 = Failure; 15 = Partial Success with a setback (they got close but didn’t hit the DC); 20 = Success; 25 = Major Success (you get some additional benefit).

> **DC Tip:** You can also do the same increments for Checks that succeed or fail by 10 or more as well! I try not to have it be TOO game-altering or punishing, but it’s nice to add some flavor to those extreme rolls.

## Complications

Going “by 5’s” is also simple when it comes to figuring out complications to a situation. Let's say there’s a scenario where a PC is trying to walk across a simple rickety wooden bridge, the DC for this could be 10 (depending on HOW rickety it was). Let's say it started to rain now, or a strong breeze picked up. Now you can just dial the DC up by one “notch” to a DC 15! Simple! And if you want to add in that the PC is being chased by bandits and needs to HURRY across as arrows and people chase them, now it's a DC 20!

It’s very simple to step the DC up or down depending on extra things that happen around the situation at hand.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

For things that happen in the world, I adjust the DC up or down by 5, or even get it to a specific number as previously stated. BUT when the PCs describe something they do based on THEIR actions, Game Masters can award Advantage (ADV) or Disadvantage (DisADV) to their roll. If they’re talking to a city guard and let it slip that they stole something, the GM can give them DisADV on their Check. If a PC comes up with a clever way to use an item or lever to lift something heavy, the GM could give them ADV on their Check.

> **DC Tip:** Don't be afraid to award ADV and DisADV for players' interactions with the world. This lets them know if they’re “on the right track” with their thinking or not.

## Failing Forward

Just because someone fails a Check of some kind… it doesn't mean they LITERALLY didn't succeed in what they were doing. If someone tries to break open a door and they fail the Might Check for it… that doesn't have to mean that the door didn't break… it could break but make such a loud noise that the guards are alerted, or maybe they’re unlucky and there’s a guard directly on the other side of the door. You could even have them smashing the door in this way lower the DC for the next person to attempt something.

It can feel really bad and take forever if you GATE progress of the story behind NEEDING to hit certain numbers. This can bring the game to a screeching halt, so instead, let them fail forward. Let each moment move the story forward in an interesting way.
