# Ancestries System

During character creation, you must choose your character’s Ancestry, which represents the physical form your character takes in the world, such as Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling and Gnome. Each Ancestry has a list of Ancestry Traits, which you can gain by spending Ancestry Points.

### Ancestry Traits

Ancestry Traits give your Character physiological properties or abilities based on your Ancestry. You can choose various combinations of Ancestry Traits to customize your Character to express the type of fantasy race you want to play.

### Ancestry Points

Ancestry Points can be spent to gain Ancestry Traits. Most Traits cost between 1 and 3 Points, however, some Traits have a Point value of 0 or lower: Minor Traits and Negative Traits.

#### Gaining Ancestry Points

When first creating your Character, you have 5 Ancestry Points. You gain additional Ancestry Points when you reach Levels 4 and 7.

### Types of Ancestry Traits

Each Ancestry has 4 kinds of Ancestry Traits.

#### Minor Ancestry Traits

These Traits cost 0 Ancestry Points and provide minor benefits that are respective of each Ancestry’s unique abilities and origins. You can only choose 1 Minor Trait.

#### Negative Ancestry Traits

These are Traits that have a negative Point value due to a penalty it gives your Character. These give you additional Ancestry Points equal to the negative value of the Trait.

> **Example:** If you choose the Negative Trait Reckless (-1), then you would gain the Trait (which reduces your PD by 1) and also gain 1 Ancestry Point (since the value of the Trait is worth -1). This now would technically give you 6 total Ancestry Points to spend now, but you will still end with a total of 5 (6 -1). 

#### Default Ancestry Traits

These are a set of pre-defined Ancestry Traits that are worth a total 5 Ancestry Points. These include a Minor Trait and may also include a Negative Trait.

> **DC Tip:** This is perfect for new players! They can just say, “I want to be an Elf” and they can get the “pre-made” list of the Elf Default Traits and be done with this step of Character Creation.

#### Expanded Ancestry Traits

These are optional Ancestry Traits that you can choose from to customize your Character’s Ancestry for either mechanical or flavor reasons.

> **DC Tip:** Some groups or GMs might choose to ignore these Expanded Ancestry Traits to speed up character creation (for new groups or for one shots) or if they want to have a “consistent” feel for all Ancestries.

## Ancestry Origins

### Ancestry Flavor vs Mechanics

#### Sidebar

Player Characters are unique in this aspect and with so many options, you are able to create a wide variety of Ancestry Origins. You can customize them and make them your own, either for mechanical reasons for certain traits you want to use, or for flavor / lore based reasons.

#### Ancestry Flavor

This is where you can say what your Character looks like based on their Ancestry. Maybe you choose Dwarf and Elf for your 2 Ancestries, now you get to decide how they look, which has nothing to do with game mechanics. Maybe you are a tall slender elf with a huge beard… or maybe you are a thick stocky dwarf with smooth hairless skin and pointy ears… or maybe you look 100% like a Dwarf… and all of those “Elven Traits” are more recessive and don't show themselves visually, you might have the EYES of an elf, but everything else looks Dwarvish.

> **DC Tip:** Maybe you love the Mechanics of a Gnome, but you really want to play a Halfling. Talk to your GM about if it is ok to 100% separate the mechanics of your character from what you visually look like. Work together and brainstorm how your Halfling Character gained the mechanics of a Gnome (either magically or through practice, etc.).

If you wanted to play a Dwarf that had a backstory of being from a long line of Dwarves, you totally can! Pick Dwarf and then ask yourself “How else do I want to express my Character?”. If you are going to be a Cleric, then maybe look into the Angel-born Traits? If you want to play a BRAVE Dwarf, then maybe look into a Halfling (they have a Halfling Bravery Trait). This does not mean that you ARE that Ancestry, or that one of your parents were, it just is a way to further express your character and let them have the Traits that best fit them.

> **DC Tip:** If your ideal Dwarf possess Traits only included in the Giantborn Ancestry list, pick some of those Traits for your “Dwarf” so you can create the type of Ancestry you have in mind. You can describe your Mixed Ancestry character as being a specific kind of Dwarf or a Dwarf/ Giantborn hybrid. You can express your Ancestry however you wish.

#### Ancestry Mechanics

This is where you choose your Ancestries based on the game mechanics of what Ancestry Traits they offer. Build out your character accordingly and then step back and see what your character would look like. I had a Player make a character that just wanted to make a BIG Barbarian, so he chose Giantborn and Orc. I asked him “what does that look like?” and we talked about it and decided that he was going to be an “Ogreborn” which ended up being a really cool enhancement to his backstory… even thought the intent on his choices was based on game mechanics.

#### Ancestry Appearance

The appearance of this new Ancestry is for the PC and GM to come up with together (also making sure it fits into the lore of the world setting). The Ancestry could look similar to an already existing Ancestry but be magically different for other reasons. The Ancestry could be an entirely new species that you want to bring into the world and mix and match Traits around to get the exact right feel for your PC.

> **DC Tip:** How I have always handled this is the visual is 100% “flavor” based and the Player can describe however they look. Then the Ancestry Points takes care of the “balance” and mechanics of what that Ancestry can do.

#### Ancestry Lore & Flavor

Each Ancestry has unique biological and cultural pieces that combine with Background to create a very unique PC.

*   Unique Biology Facts
*   Ancestry Quirks Table
*   Names List
*   Ancestries Culture

This will be available at the release of the full game. The Beta is focused on the mechanics of the game, so the “flavor & lore” will be revealed in the future.

## Ancestry Creation

Every Character starts with the Base Ancestry Traits below, and your Ancestry gives you a list of additional Traits that you can spend your 5 Ancestry Points on.

### Base Ancestry Traits

*   **Size:** Your Size is Medium.
*   **Speed:** You have a Speed of 5 Spaces.
*   **Creature Type:** Your Creature Type is Humanoid.

### Choose Your Ancestry

Pick 1 or 2 Ancestries to show where your Character comes from, what they look like, or how you want your Character to perform mechanically. This represents what Ancestry your Characters parents were. When you select an Ancestry you gain access to its Ancestry Traits List (Default and Expanded).

#### Starting with 1 Ancestry

You gain access to its Ancestry List. You can choose a second Ancestry when you gain additional Ancestry Points at Levels 4 or 7.

> **DC Tip:** This does give you less options during Character Creation, but gives you more flexibility to choose a second Ancestry at later time as the direction you take your Character evolves.

#### Starting with 2 Ancestries

You gain access to both Ancestry Lists of each chosen Ancestry.

> **DC Tip:** This option gives you more options during Character Creation, but less flexibility at higher levels when you gain additional Ancestry Points

### Spend Your Ancestry Points

You have 5 Ancestry Points to spend on any Ancestry Traits from among your Ancestry Trait Lists. Your Ancestry needs to have a total of 5 Ancestry Points worth of Traits (including negative Traits). You can choose multiple Negative Traits, but you can only choose 1 Minor Trait. You must spend all your Ancestry points during Character Creation (you can’t save them for later).

### Duplicate Ancestry Traits

You can’t choose a Trait of the same name multiple times, unless it says so otherwise.

> **Example:** A PC chooses Dwarf and Giantborn as their 2 Ancestries. The Tough Ancestry Trait is available to both Ancestries. The PC could only choose the Tough Ancestry Trait once, even though it’s available to both Ancestries.

### Ancestry Trait Requirements

If an Ancestry Trait has a requirement, such as a Level requirement, then you must meet that requirement to choose that Ancestry Trait.

### Attribute & Mastery Increases

Certain Ancestry Traits grant increases to Attributes, Skills, and Trades. These Ancestry Traits can’t exceed the Attribute Limit, Skill Mastery Limit, or Trade Mastery Limit, unless they say so otherwise.

### Repeated Feature Refunds

If you gain a Talent or Feature that grants you a benefit that’s identical to (or a better version of) an Ancestry Trait you have, you can choose to immediately replace that Ancestry Trait with 1 or more other Ancestry Traits available to you that are worth the same amount of Ancestry Points.

> **Example 1:** A Dwarf with the Natural Combatant Ancestry Trait (grants Mastery with Heavy Armor and all Shields) uses their 2nd Level Talent to pick the Martial Expansion Talent (grants Mastery with all Weapons, Armors, and Shields), then the Dwarf would be refunded the Ancestry Points they spent to gain Natural Combatant and would need to immediately use those Points to gain a different Ancestry Trait available to them.
>
> **Example 2:** If you have an Ancestry Trait that grants you Water Breathing and Swim Speed, then later you gain a Class Feature that ONLY grants a Swim Speed (but not Water Breathing), that would NOT count and you would not get any Ancestry Points refunded to you (you would keep both). If you later get another feature that ONLY grants Water Breathing, you could now get a refund for the Ancestry Trait since you now have other Features or Talents granting you the exact same (or better) abilities.

> **DC Tip:** There might be a scenario where a Minor Trait is replaced by a Feature or Talent. In this case a GM could allow a Player to pick from another Minor Trait from another Ancestry (if it would make sense for that PC).

## Variant Rules

### Custom Ancestries

If you want to create a PC with a completely custom Ancestry or want to combine 3 or more Ancestries together, you can create a Custom Ancestry. This gives Characters access to ALL Ancestry Lists at once but only gets 4 points to spend instead of 5. All other Ancestry Creation Rules still apply.

> **DC Tip:** This would be a Variant Rule within a Variant Rule. You could choose to have PCs get the full 5 Ancestry Points for creating their Custom Ancestry, but keep in mind this would be VERY strong and the default option for most everyone at the table (for both min maxing and RP reasons). If you are ok with this, then let them have the full 5 Points instead of 4.

### Stronger or Weaker Ancestries

Game Masters can choose to start the game off with higher or lower Ancestry Point totals (instead of 5).

*   **Lower Points:** If you don’t want there to be as much power that comes from Ancestries and want it to be more of a Subtle thing they get, you can lower it down to 4,3, or 2. The PC would have to choose which Default Ancestry Traits (or Expanded Ancestry Traits) they get to equal that total.
*   **Higher Points:** if you want to give your players more power and customization at the start of the game you can give them more points here (or use the Free Starting Talent Variant Rule). This gives the PCs 6 or more points to build a stronger Ancestry with.

> **DC Tip:** I would be very careful with this, the game is balanced around PCs getting 5 points and there could be some very powerful combinations (especially if combined with other more powerful options for starting the game off).

### Ancestry Adoption

This option allows you to select one Ancestry Trait from any Ancestry available, then follow the rules as written for spending the rest of your Ancestry Points.

> **DC Tip:** You could be making this choice for tactical combat reasons, roleplay reasons or anything in between. Talk to your GM (and even the rest of your party) to show what unique twist you have added to your PC.

### Ancestry “Magic Items”

This option allows you to “think outside the box” on why your PC can do what they can do and where they got these “powers” from. With this rule, you can choose from ANY of the Ancestry Traits and give yourself a “magic item” that represents that power. You can do this multiple times for multiple points worth of traits. You can tie all these points into a single item or into multiple items.

> **Example:** You want to play a “normal” Human PC, but you REALLY want to have a Breath Weapon (from the Dragonborn Ancestry) and you DON’T want to say that you are “part Dragonborn”. You can create a Human with 3 points spent in the Human Ancestry and with the other 2 points, you can get the Dragonborn’s Breath Weapon, but you could describe that it comes from a “magic ring” on your finger. This allows you to play the fantasy of a human, while still having the “magical abilities” that you want.

> **DC Tip:** I have done this myself with Class Features before. I had a PC who was a complete commoner… but he happen to find a magic sword and as soon as he picked it up he was granted the powers of a Spellblade. If I ever lost the sword, then those powers were gone. Its a very unique way to make a unique PC.

#### GM and PC Notes

Keep in mind that this “feature” is now being represented by an object that is not part of the PC. This means that it could be stolen or possibly work differently if the PCs go to an area that cancels all magic items (then the ring would not work). So have an open dialogue with each other about this and how it might look at your table.

*   **(0) Redeemed:** You can now spend your Ancestry Points on Angelborn Traits.

### Beastborn

This is a unique Ancestry in that it doesn’t have ANY Default Traits. Instead, Beastborn get access to a category of Expanded Traits called Beast Traits. You can spend your Ancestry Points on any of the Beast Traits below.

#### Beastborn Origin

*   **(0) Beastkind:** You can understand and speak to (in a limited capacity) the species of Beast your Beastborn is modeled after. You can understand the meaning of their noises and behaviors, and they understand the meanings of simple words, concepts, or states of emotion.

> **DC Tip:** It’s up to the GM how far the category of the beast you choose can be applied. If you chose turtle, for example, it might reference ONLY turtles or might include other reptiles as well.
