## Spellblade

Spellblades combine their combat prowess with their
ability to harness and channel magic into weapons. They
can form a bond with a weapon to imbue it with damage,
call it back to them, and more. Spellblades can learn a wide
range of disciplines depending on their unique combination
of martial and spellcasting prowess. They even gain the
ability to cast spells through their weapons.

**Source of Power:** Spellblades are unique in that there are a
variety of ways and sources for them to harness their power.
They could draw this magic from a wide variety of sources.
Here are just a few examples:

* Power bestowed by a patron, deity, or some powerful
entity that takes an interest in them.
* An external or supernatural force that even they don’t
fully understand.
* Their own bloodline or connections to the past.
* Their careful study and practice of both swords and spells.
* They take up their blade in honor of a deity, cause, or
goal.
* They make an oath or vow to someone (or themselves) to
stand for or against something.
* An expression of emotion through artistic flourishes with
their weapon.
* A strange weapon they pulled from a stone granted them
the powers of a Spellblade.

You regain 1 SP when you Hit with a Spell Attack or
succeed on a Spell Check, provided you don’t spend SP as
part of that Action.

##### Bound Weapon

During a Quick Rest, you can magically bond with 1
Weapon and choose an Elemental or Mystical damage type
to become your Bound Damage type. This bond lasts until
you end it for free or use this feature again.

Your Bound Weapon gains the following properties:

Damage per SP spent. When you do, you also gain the

Spaces of Dim or Bright Light (you choose the light’s
appearance). You can extinguish, produce, or adjust the
level of this illumination at any time for free.
* **Recall:** While the Weapon is within 20 Spaces and isn’t
being held or secured, you can call your Weapon back to
you for free, causing it to fly to you. If you don’t have a
free hand when you call it, or you choose not to grab it, it
falls in your Space at your feet.
* **Ending Early:** Your bond with the Weapon ends early if
you use this Feature again, or you choose to end it for free.

Make a DC 10 Spell Check. **Success:** You can restore up to 3 HP. **Success (each 5):** +1 HP. **Failure:** You only restore up to 2 HP.
    * **Cure:** You can attempt to remove 1 Poison or Disease from a creature of your choice within 1 Space of you. Make a Spell Check against the DC of the Poison or Disease. **Success:** The chosen Poison or Disease ends on the target.
* **Hex Warrior:** You can spend 1 AP and 1 MP to Curse a
creature within 10 Spaces for 1 minute. You make a Spell
Check against the target’s Repeated Physical Save. **Save
Failure:** The target is Dazed or Impaired (your choice)
and takes 1 Umbral damage at the start of each of their
turns. Additionally, they’re prevented from regaining HP.
* **Spell Breaker:** You can spend 2 AP to initiate a Spell Duel
against a Spell Attack using a Weapon instead of casting a
Spell, provided the Initiator or a target of the Spell is within
the range of your Weapon. When you do, you make an
Attack Check and you can spend SP and MP (for a total up
to your Mana Spend Limit) to gain a bonus on your Check
equal to the SP and MP spent. You have ADV on your
Check if you are within 1 Space of the Initiator.
* **Spell Warder:** When you deal Elemental or Mystical
damage with an Attack, you gain Resistance (1) to that

location until the end of your next turn. **Check Failure:**
You learn nothing and can’t use this Feature against the
target again until you complete a Long Rest.

#### Level 2 Class Features

##### Spellstrike

Once on each of your turns when you make a Martial
Attack, you can also cast a Spell as part of the same Action,
spending 1 AP less than normal.

* **Converged Action:** When you do, the Spell can only target
1 creature who must be a target of the Attack, and the range
of the Attack can’t exceed the range of the Spell. The Spell
uses the Attack Check as its Spell Check for any of its
requirements, and any Saves you force the target to make
are made against your Save DC.
* **Harmonic Strike:** The Attack and Spell from a Spellstrike
are treated as 1 Attack, and can benefit from Maneuvers
and Spell Enhancements. The Spell doesn’t require
Somatic Components.

> **DC Tip:** Because it’s treated as 1 Attack, the damage from the
Attack and Spell benefit from Critical Hits, Heavy Hits, and
beyond only once.

> **Example 1:** A Spellblade makes a Weapon Attack using a
Shortsword (1 Slashing damage) as part of the Attack Action.
They choose to use Spellstrike, which lets them also cast a
Spell as part of the same Action. They choose the Firebolt
Spell (2 Fire damage). Normally the Spell costs 1 AP to cast,
but now costs 0 AP (since Spellstrike reduces its cost by
1). On a Hit, the Spellstrike deals 3 total damage (1 Slashing
and 2 Fire).

> **Extended Example 1:** The same Spellblade from Example
1 can add even more to their Spellstrike, by spending AP to
perform Attack or Save Maneuvers or to add the Firebolt
Spell’s AP Enhancement options. You can also spend SP to
use Smite or perform additional Maneuvers.

##### Talent
You gain 1 Talent of your choice. If the Talent has any prerequisites, you must meet those prerequisites to choose that Talent.

### SubClass: Paragon Spellblade

#### Sling-Blade

*Requirements:* Spellstrike, Level 3

You’re able to sling magic off your blade to extend the range
of your Spells and Attacks in the following ways:

* **Distant Strike:** The range of your Attacks with Melee
Weapons is increased by 2.
* **Extended Spellstrike:** When you use Spellstrike, the
range of the Spell changes to match your Weapon’s range.

> **Example:** If a Spellblade casts the Light Spell (range of 1
Space) using their Spellstrike feature, and uses a Shortbow
as the Weapon (range of 15/45) then normally the range
would be limited to 1 Space (the Spell’s range), but using
Extended Spellstrike the range would match the Weapon’s
full range (up to 45 Spaces).

#### Adaptive Bond

*Requirements:* Bound Weapon, Level 3

You’re able to adapt your Bound Weapon to match the
situation. You gain the following benefits:

* At the start of your turn, you can switch your Bound
Damage type for free, or you can spend 1 AP do to so
during your turn.
* After you take Elemental or Mystical damage from
an Attack, you can immediately change your Bound
Damage type to a damage type dealt by the Attack for
free.
* You gain Resistance (1) to your Bound Damage.

> **Example:** A Spellblade is fighting several Fire Elementals.
When a Fire Elemental hits the Spellblade with an Attack
that deals Fire damage, the Spellblade can change its Bound
Damage to Fire after the Attack is resolved. The Spellblade
then has Fire Resistance against the next Attack against them.
